Does Providing Free Trial Packs With Demonstration Plots Increase the Adoption of Agricultural Technologies? Cost Effectiveness Evidence From Tanzania,"This study evaluates the effectiveness of the common practice of providing free trial packs alongside demonstration plots managed by local extension agents to promote learning‐by‐doing and increase technology adoption among bean farmers in Tanzania. The experiment randomly assigned some villages to forgo trial packs containing seeds and a seed treatment for 1 year. Adoption data were collected 1 and 4 years after the intervention. Our findings show that trial packs raised program costs by 37.5 times, but did not lead to a significant or cost‐justified increase in adoption. The adoption of improved bean varieties increased from 11% pre‐intervention to 28% 4 years post‐intervention, with no significant difference between villages with and without trial packs. Although trial packs showed potential for specific groups—such as female, more educated farmers, households in farmer groups, and those living closer to demonstration plots or in smaller villages—their overall impact was limited. These results suggest that demonstration plots, a lower‐cost intervention, are more cost‐effective. Trial packs may still hold value when targeted, but their widespread use does not justify the additional costs. This study offers key insights for policymakers and development practitioners seeking to implement scalable, efficient agricultural interventions.",2025.0,Agricultural Economics,Agricultural Economics,"M.

Contaminated water spillovers or peer effects? Determinants of disease outbreaks in shrimp farming in Vietnam,"Disease outbreaks are one of the major issues in the aquaculture sector and can lead to significant economic losses. Although the source of the disease is difficult to trace, understanding how it occurs is important to mitigate the problem. A crucial factor that has not received sufficient attention is the presence of spillovers among fish farmers connected by waterways. This study examines the presence of spillovers among shrimp farmers in Southern Vietnam based on primary data. In particular, it quantifies the effects of contaminated water spillovers from one farm to another and the peer effects of farming practices among neighbors. We solve the reflection problem by employing a method developed in social network analyses. The findings indicate that a farmer's practices are affected by their neighbors’ farming practices. Further, the disease outbreak in a farmer's pond is affected by those in their neighbors’ ponds, even after controlling for contextual peer effects and correlated effects. The negative effects of neighbors’ ponds on the probability of disease outbreaks in a farmer's pond may offset the positive effects of the farmer's good farming practices, suggesting the importance of considering neighboring farmers as a group when addressing the issue of disease control.",2024.0,Agricultural Economics,Agricultural Economics,"Aya Suzuki, Susan Olivia, Vu Hoang Nam, Guenwoo Lee",10.1111/agec.12872,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/084c42e57b41a75585906750f3d380cd4c7ac084,61.0,1.0,0.0,,"[{'category': 'Environmental Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12872,['JournalArticle'],2024-12-25,True,True,matches theoretical benchmark,ambiguous,strong evidence,risk mitigated through networks,suggests effective intervention,sustained over time,pessimistic
Does the European Union Start-Up Aid Help Young Farmers to Innovate and to Join Networks?,"The endurance and vitality of European agriculture are threatened by the aging of farmers, together with the lack of generational change. The small share of young farmers also impacts on the innovative capacity and competitiveness of the sector. The Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union started addressing the issue long ago by providing financial aid to help young farmers to start up. Over time, the aid increased and packages of measures were set to reinforce the aid and to promote investments, innovations, and networks at the farm level. While the literature focuses on analyzing the effectiveness of the start-up aid in fostering new entries, this paper assumes an original perspective as it seeks to assess whether this aid has actually promoted innovations and networks in the beneficiary farms. The analysis relies on sample data collected in 2021 in Italy and Poland via interviews of 500 farmers under 40 who had entered the sector both with and without the aid. A probit model estimates whether the beneficiaries have a higher probability to innovate and network. Then, the contribution of the aid to the intensity of the adoption of innovations and networks is estimated via an Average Treatment Effect on the Treated model (ATT). Results suggest that the start-up aid increased the adoption of innovations and networks. The ATT indicates that this positive effect holds even after correcting for self-selection bias. By adopting an original perspective, our analysis suggests that the start-up aid for young farmers goes beyond rejuvenating agriculture by fostering innovation at the farm level and by promoting networking, thus enhancing agricultural change. However, farmer behaviors in the two countries are different, suggesting quite complex patterns for the impact of this measure.",2024.0,Agriculture,Agriculture,"Anna Carbone, F.

"Talking water: interplay of gender, trust and expertise in agricultural extension groups in Mendoza, Argentina","
 Stakeholder adaptation is a critical strategy to overcome changing climate patterns worldwide. Still it relies on the speed and effectiveness of information flow to end-users. Research shows that the loss of information in several stages of its spread and learning from peers is more important than the knowledge circulated by extension services. Women’s participation and contribution are supportive and strategic, depending on the level of agreement and the interplay of trust variables within the network. In the arid Andes, agriculture is central and dependent on water management and macroeconomic conditions that shape market prospects, irrigation practices, and stakeholder behavior. Data were collected using the platform of a capacity-building program for organisations of water users in the Diamante and Atuel River basins in Mendoza, Argentina. Social Network Analysis (SNA) contributes to unveiling the cornerstones of information flow by identifying group structures, strong bonds, and bottlenecks in water management systems. In the first step, we evaluated the characteristics (density, centrality, average shortest path, and degree) of the pre-existing relationships and five sub-topic networks. Second, we compare networks containing pre-existing links only with those formed during the lecture. Emphasizing adaptation practices to cope with climate change impacts, the results provide valuable insights into the intricate interplay of gender dynamics, trust, expertise recognition, and discussion patterns within water and agricultural extension groups in Argentina. These insights highlight the ongoing need to promote gender equity, address biases in expertise recognition, and leverage trust for meaningful knowledge exchanges within evolving social contexts. It also reveals the alignment of Argentina's gender performance with similar production setups in Southern America or the Global North, highlighting the universality of challenges and opportunities in fostering inclusive and equitable participation. Our findings indicate that each group within the two river basins exhibits numerous pre-existing links and tends to be less accessible to newcomers, resulting in a shorter average path. Thus, information can spread faster. Trust is an underlying facilitator for sensible topics and a catalyzer for communication.",2024.0,Environmental Research: Climate,Environmental Research: Climate,"F. S. Riera, C.

Impact of social networks on fertilizer use efficiency in China: Evidence from kiwifruit production in Shaanxi province,"Improving fertilizer use efficiency (FUE) is an effective way to reduce the fertilizer use and non-point source pollution in agriculture production in China. Existing research related to fertilizer use efficiency ignores the impact of famers’ social networks, which can significantly affect the fertilizer use and its efficiency. This paper analyzed the impact of social networks on fertilizer use efficiency and the mediator effect of green fertilization technology adoption, based on the calculation of fertilizer use efficiency of 569 kiwifruit farmers in Shaanxi province of China surveyed in 2021 by using stochastic frontier method. The results show that the FUE of kiwifruit production ranged within 0.1027–0.9945, with an average value of 0.333, which showed great variability, and fertilizer input had an average 66.7% reduction potential without reducing output. Social networks and its four dimensions all had a significant positive impact on FUE, in which network trust and network learning had a greater impact on FUE. Farmers’ adoption of green fertilization technology played a positive mediator effect in the process of social networks influencing their fertilizer use efficiency, which was mainly promoted by network trust and learning. Farmers’ experience in agricultural production, joining the cooperative, the quantity of village agricultural supply points had a significant positive impact on fertilizer use efficiency, while age and gentle of the head of household had a significant negative impact of fertilizer use efficiency. Planting scale had a U-shape impact on FUE. Policies aimed at improving FUE and reducing non-point source pollution should, therefore, focus on improving the social networks of farmers, especially young farmers, strengthening network trust, promoting network learning, network reciprocity and network interaction, strengthening the research and development and extension of green fertilization technology, encouraging farmers to join agricultural cooperative, improving village production conditions, guiding sustainable agricultural production.",2023.0,Environmental science and pollution research international,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Fangyuan Chang, Li Liu, Yu Wang, Jundi Liu, Xiuguang Bai",10.1007/s11356-023-29508-3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/603eceabbd1e4c76b9f9d634fca864f5e77555b9,69.0,9.0,0.0,['Medicine'],"[{'category': 'Medicine', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Environmental Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2710431/latest.pdf,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",2023-09-01,True,True,matches theoretical benchmark,ambiguous,strong evidence,risk mitigated through networks,suggests effective intervention,sustained over time,optimistic
"Household and plot-level survey data on adoption, outcomes, and perceptions of early sown wheat and zero tillage in Northwest India","This study collected evidence on the use of early sown wheat varieties and complementary zero tillage technologies in Northwest India. Detailed information on farmers’ knowledge, adoption decisions, personal experience, and perceptions of early sown wheat and zero tillage technologies were collected at the household level using different survey tools. Additional information on agricultural practices during the Rabi Season 2021/22 were collected at the plot level and geocoded. Overall, the dataset comprises responses from 1206 wheat farmers in 70 villages across 7 districts in Punjab and Haryana that were collected between September and October 2022. The villages were selected using stratified random sampling based on a sampling frame of 1722 communities that had been identified as predominantly wheat growing areas based on remote-sensing data from satellite images. The dataset provides rich information that may be used for assessing the diffusion and impact of recently developed wheat varieties designed for early sowing, identifying barriers to the wider adoption of these technologies, and informing policy making aimed at improving adoption and usage decisions of agricultural innovations.",2023.0,Scientific Data,Scientific Data,"Dominik Naeher, Basma H.

Pathways from information to the adoption of conservation agriculture practices in Malawi and Tanzania,"Abstract To reduce agriculture's carbon, land and water footprint, the diffusion of conservation farming methods is one commonly cited proposition. Yet the process of translating available information on new conservation farming methods into farmers' practices is often a black box in many studies. This understanding is critical to inform strategies for scaling these complex, knowledge-intensive, but necessary practices for improving agriculture's resource and climate balance sheet. By implementing a series of mediation analysis using data from 700 households in Malawi and 930 households in Tanzania, this study examines how an improved understanding of conservation agriculture (CA) principles is an important mediator in the pathway from extension contact to the adoption of two of the CA practices examined. For the adoption of conservation tillage, the share of the mediated treatment effect was in the 31.5–34.4% range, while it was 31.6–46.9% for the adoption of soil cover (mulching). Our results suggest that unless learning from external sources strongly correlates with improved farmers' technical understanding of new farming practices, private learning by doing must be a critical adjunct to other avenues of learning. Beyond the basic promotional goals, improving farmers' technical know-how needs to be the centerpiece of holistic efforts in support of conservation farming and similar knowledge-intensive practices necessary for agriculture's sustinability goals.",2023.0,Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems,Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems,"P.

"The adoption of conservation practices in the Corn Belt: the role of one formal farmer network, Practical Farmers of Iowa","Substantial evidence has shown that involvement in peer-to-peer farming networks influences whether a farmer decides to try a new practice. Formally organized farmer networks are emerging as a unique entity that blend the benefits of decentralized exchange of farmer knowledge within the structure of an organization providing a variety of sources of information and forms of engagement. We define formal farmer networks as farmer networks with a distinct membership and organizational structure, leadership that includes farmers, and an emphasis on peer-to-peer learning. This study complements existing ethnographic research on the benefits of organized farmer networking by examining farmers in one longstanding formal farmer network, Practical Farmers of Iowa. Using a nested, mixed-method research design, we analyzed survey and interview data to understand how participation and forms of engagement in the network are associated with the adoption of conservation practices. Responses from 677 farmers from a regular member survey disseminated by Practical Farmers of Iowa in 2013, 2017, and 2020 were pooled and analyzed. GLM binomial and ordered logistic regression results indicate that greater participation in the network, particularly through in-person formats, has a strong and significant association with greater adoption of conservation practices. Logistic regression results show that building relationships in the network is the most important variable for predicting whether a farmer reported adopting conservation practices as a result of participation in PFI. In-depth interviews with 26 surveyed member farmers revealed that PFI supports farmers to adopt by providing information, resources, encouragement, confidence building, and reinforcement. In-person learning formats were more important to farmers relative to independent formats because they were able to have side conversations with other farmers, ask questions, and observe results. We conclude that formal networks are a promising way to expand the use of conservation practices, particularly through targeted efforts to increase relationship building in the network through face-to-face learning opportunities.",2023.0,Agriculture and Human Values,Agriculture and Human Values,"L.

Theoretical framework and methods for the analysis of the adoption-diffusion of innovations in agriculture: a bibliometric review,"The adoption and diffusion of innovations are essential for both the development of production processes and the improvement of agricultural environmental sustainability, at any stage of the value chain. In recent years, social scientists have studied the diffusion and adoption of agricultural innovations from different approaches, such as innovation diffusion theory, behavioral models, econometric models, social capital and social network analysis, among others. In this study we analyze the scientific literature through a bibliometric analysis based on co-citation networks, to explore the theoretical pillars and bibliographic coupling, with which we explore the current methodological research trends of the last 50 years. The conclusions drawn from this analysis are that in recent years agricultural researchers on adoption and diffusion have designed multivariate methods that combine diverse study approaches.

"The Effect of Social Network on Controlled-Release Fertilizer Use: Evidence from Rice Large-Scale Farmers in Jiangsu Province, China","The reduction and efficiency of fertilizer use has been a recent focus of governments and scholars. As a new agricultural technology, controlled-release fertilizer can not only increase yield and save labor, but also improve efficiency and reduce the use of fertilizer, thus promoting sustainable agricultural development. Drawing on a sample of 231 farmers of Jiangsu Province, China, this paper applies a probit model to assess the adoption behavior of controlled-release fertilizer by large-scale households in terms of three dimensions of social network, i.e., communication intensity, trust level, and network size, specifically exploring how science popularization influences their adoption intention, and comparing the heterogeneity of impact that social network has on the adoption intention of farmers when the information is obtained adequately or not. The empirical results demonstrate that: (1) At the early stage of technology diffusion, the size of social network has a positive effect on farmers’ cognition of controlled-release fertilizer, and the communication intensity with neighboring farmers has a positive effect on the adoption behavior of controlled-release fertilizer; (2) Farmers’ adoption intention of controlled-release fertilizer is significantly influenced by their original knowledge of new technology and science popularization; (3) When the information is sufficient, the social network of large-scale households has no significant effect on their willingness to adopt. Therefore, in promoting controlled-release fertilizer, the government should highlight the synergistic effect of farmers’ cognition and science popularization activities, fully consider the characteristics of farmers’ social network, facilitate the infrastructure of rural informatization, and regulate the agricultural promotion networks so that farmers can obtain sufficient and effective information.",2023.0,Sustainability,Sustainability,"Ruoxi Ma, Shangguang Yang",10.3390/su15042982,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c7f1fadf63a1961bba62ee1b040babce3a768161,54.0,5.0,0.0,,"[{'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Sociology', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/4/2982/pdf?version=1675759381,,2023-02-07,True,True,matches theoretical benchmark,ambiguous,strong evidence,risk mitigated through institutions,suggests effective intervention,sustained over time,optimistic
"Suburban agriculture, immigrant farmers, and access to agricultural services and resources","While agricultural services are shrinking, the num­ber of nontraditional farms run by immigrant farm­ers is rising in U.S. suburban regions. This study attempts to understand Chinese immigrant farmers’ experience accessing agricultural services and resources in the New York metropolitan area and explores the need for changes in agricultural ser­vices to meet changing demand. Thirteen Chinese immigrant farmers in the region were recruited to participate in a semi-structured interview to under­stand their shared experiences of accessing agricul­tural services and resources. The study identified diverse ways of accessing agricultural services and resources in four critical areas of farming opera­tions: agricultural technology, financial services, farm labor, and farming machinery; and also revealed the existence of “liability of newness” among those new immigrant farmers in operating farms. Most participants felt that they were iso­lated, with limited access to available services as new immigrant farmers, which constitutes the lia­bilities to their success in farming. Language barri­ers, cultural differences, distrust, and isolation were the main obstacles to access adequate services and resources. As farms and farmers are becoming more diverse in U.S. suburban regions, the provi­sion of agricultural services needs to adapt accord­ingly to meet the growing needs of groups of farm­ers with varying farming experiences and demographic backgrounds and help them to over­come the liabilities as new immigrant farmers.

Farmers’ social networks and regional spillover effects in agricultural climate change mitigation,"Climate change poses a severe threat to global agricultural production and rural livelihoods, and since agriculture itself is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it can also play an important role in climate change mitigation. This article investigates how farmers’ social networks influence the adoption of on-farm mitigation strategies. More precisely, we use a network autocorrelation model to explore the relationship between a farmer’s own mitigation behavior and the mitigation behavior and knowledge of his fellow farmers. The analysis is based on a regional case study in Switzerland and uses data obtained from personal network interviews combined with survey and census data of 50 farmers. Half of them are members of a local collective action initiative for agricultural climate change mitigation, while the others do not participate in the initiative. We find that, on average, farmers with a larger network adopt more mitigation measures, and furthermore, mitigation adoption is linked with the level of knowledge within farmers’ networks. Indeed, the likelihood that non-members will adopt mitigation measures increases if they are closely associated with members of the collective action, suggesting a local spillover effect. It follows that strengthening knowledge exchange among farmers and supporting local farmers’ initiatives can potentially contribute to the diffusion of agricultural climate change mitigation practices.",2023.0,Climatic Change,Climatic Change,"Cordelia Kreft, Mario Angst, R.

Despite neutral recruitment language and no expectation that participants would alter food intake in response to the assessment procedures, we found a substantial learning-by-doing effect in plate waste reduction as those who document greater plate waste in their captured photographs waste less on subsequent days.

Social interaction and geographic diffusion of iron‐biofortified beans in Rwanda,"This study analyzes smallholder farmers’ decisions to adopt beans with higher levels of dietary iron developed through a conventional breeding technique called biofortification. We approach this study by applying spatial econometric techniques to estimate neighborhood influence and to determine the factors driv-ing the adoption of iron-biofortified beans (IBB). We employ a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of bean producing households from 2015 bean growing season B in Rwanda, and present results for growers of both bush and climbing varieties of beans. The results show geographic diffusion of iron bean planting material occurs among neighboring farmers that exhibit interdependent decision-making patterns, as well as similar characteristics relative to the group. Some policy implications can be drawn from the results. First, a differentiated geographical targeting strategy for bush and climbing bean varieties as a function of farmer and farm characteristics should increase iron bean adoption rates. Second, strengthening partnerships with delivery agents and extensionists should stimulate the adoption of IBB varieties. And finally, technology-promotion programs that consider progressive farmers and strengthen social interactions and group activities among peer networks should increase the spread of information and diffusion of IBB.",2022.0,Agricultural Economics,Agricultural Economics,"J.

Stimulating Innovations for Sustainable Agricultural Practices among Smallholder Farmers: Persistence of Intervention Matters,"Abstract As part of the dissemination of sustainable intensification (SI) of agricultural practices in northern Ghana, farmers were conditionally induced with inputs to adopt the SI practices. We study the effects of the conditional inducement on maize yield and net income of farmers under a quasi-randomised phase-out design. We examine the effects of the inducement by comparing continuous induced farmers with past induced and non-induced farmers. Our results indicate that the conditional inducement led to an increase in the maize yield and the net income of continuously induced farmers, on average. Estimates also suggest that the continuously induced farmers would have had their maize yields and net incomes decreased by about 64 per cent and 54 per cent, respectively if the inducement had been discontinued. Distributional analysis reveals that the inducement effects are heterogeneous and that past inducement impacted more on the maize yield and the net income of farmers at the lower quantiles. We conclude that appropriate conditional inducement can stimulate farmers’ adoption.

"Social Network, Production Purpose, and Biological Pesticide Application Behavior of Rice Farmers","The extension and diffusion of the green production mode in rural areas forms the micro basis for improve the ecological environment. While government has issued a series of policies to promote the green production mode, the effect depends on farmers’ behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the causes and mechanisms underlying the influence of farmers’ behavior differences with regard to biopesticide application. Based on 1202 sampled rice farmers in China, this paper analyzes the impact of social network on their biological pesticide application behavior. Furthermore, the internal transmission mechanism of social network on biological pesticide application behavior of “ration-making” farmers (whose main purpose is to meet the demand for rations) and “profit-making” famers (whose main goal is to maximize their profit) is studied according to different production purposes. The results show that: 1) Social network has a significant positive role in promoting rice farmers’ biological pesticide application behavior. 2) Social network encourages rice farmers to apply biological pesticides by influencing both their behavioral attitude and behavioral efficacy toward green production. 3) The intermediary effect of behavioral efficacy exceeds that of behavioral attitude. 4) Compared with “profit-making” farmers, the biological pesticides application of “ration-making” farmers is stronger affected by their social network. Operation mode, operation scale, and educational level positively affect the pesticide application behavior of “profit-making” farmers, while age imposes a significantly negative influence. Biopesticide application of “ration-making” farmers is negatively affected by age and education level and positively affected by the mode of operation. 5) The behavioral attitude and behavioral efficacy of green production exert significant mediating effects on both types of farmers. Moreover, both intermediary variables exert stronger impacts on “profit-making” farmers. To a certain extent, this study expands the theoretical explanation of the “rational man” in neoclassical economics, and provides reliable evidence, both theoretical and empirical, for effective measures to stimulate green production in rice farmers.",2022.0,Frontiers in Environmental Science,,"Zhaoliang Li, Mande Zhu, Q.

Mobile money networks with tax-incentives,"Mobile money (MM) is the most promising tool to enable more individuals living in rural and marginalized communities into the banking sector. Although private companies in some developing countries have transitioned most of its users over to MM, it remains unclear if government-initiated programs would be as successful. By accessing a comprehensive data set of the first MM project to be initiated by a government, we tracked the behavior of users within the MM network. Temporal analysis of network representations of MM transactions shows how agents behave over time and how they react when given tax-incentives for the use of non-cash transactions. Tax-incentives had immediate positive effects on the economic activity of continuing users (number of transactions, mean and total value of transactions) and a marginal effect on their interconnectedness (number of partners and clustering). However, the tax-incentive distorted economic behavior and had a modest effect on the adoption and diffusion of MM over time at a high price tag. Implementation of these new technologies requires consideration of the peculiarity of the different actors and the expansion of the network over time, as well as the specific characteristics of each economy. These findings offer important lessons that would be valuable to other governments and policymakers considering MM.",2022.0,Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,"I.

Modeling and Simulation of Dissemination of Cultivated Land Protection Policies in China,"Cultivated land protection is the top priority of the national economy in China and the livelihood of people. Cultivated land protection policies (CLPP) play an important role in the protection of cultivated land. However, the process of dissemination of CLPP on social networks of farmers has problems, such as distortion of policy content, single dissemination channels, low level of farmers’ knowledge, and low dissemination efficiency. For revealing the characteristics of the dissemination of CLPP in the farmers’ social networks (FSN), this study combines the Suspected–Exposed–Infected–Recovered–Suspected (SEIRS) epidemic model to construct a model of CLPP dissemination suitable for FSN. In addition, a numerical simulation of the dissemination process of CLPP is conducted on the FSN, and the influence of the structural characteristics of the FSN and different model parameters on the dissemination of CLPP is analyzed. Results show that (1) the dissemination rate between farmers in FSN has a significant impact on the scale and speed of CLPP. A greater initial dissemination rate corresponds to faster speed and larger scale of CLPP dissemination. (2) A greater node degree in FSN means stronger dissemination ability for CLPP. Therefore, identifying structural holes (opinion leaders) in FSN can effectively promote the dissemination of CLPP. (3) The SEIRS model can dynamically describe the evolution law of CLPP dissemination process over time through the four states of farmer nodes of suspected, exposed, infected, and recovered. Numerical simulation results show that the immune degradation rate is proportional to CLPP. However, the direct immunization rate is inversely proportional. The increase in immune degradation rate can reduce the number of recovered farmers and improve the efficiency of CLPP dissemination. On the basis of the abovementioned conclusions, this study draws policy recommendations to increase the scale and speed of CLPP dissemination in China.",2021.0,Land,Land,"Xinhai Lu, Yanwei Zhang, Handong Tang",10.3390/LAND10020160,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba8bb283e4013a8be181f390d1aaffcaa7e9bdd7,52.0,10.0,0.0,['Business'],"[{'category': 'Business', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Environmental Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/10/2/160/pdf?version=1612748563,,2021-02-05,True,True,matches theoretical benchmark,ambiguous,strong evidence,risk mitigated through networks,suggests effective intervention,sustained over time,optimistic
Traditional knowledge affects soil management ability of smallholder farmers in marginal areas,"Soil fertility is key to sustainable intensification of agriculture and food security in sub-Saharan Africa. However, when soil nutrients are not adequately managed, smallholder farming practices slowly erode soils to almost inert systems. This case study contributes to the understanding of such failures in marginal areas. We integrate agronomic and social sciences approaches to explore links between smallholder households’ farming knowledge and soil fertility in an ethnopedological perspective. We interview 280 smallholder households in two areas of the Ethiopian highlands, while collecting measures of 11 soil parameters at their main field. By analyzing soil compositions at tested households, we identify a novel measure of soil management ability, which provides an effective empirical characterization of the soil managing capacity of a household. Regression analysis is used to evaluate the effects of household knowledge on the soil management ability derived from laboratory analysis. Results highlight the complexity of knowledge transmission in low-input remote areas. We are able to disentangle a home learning and a social learning dimension of the household knowledge and appraise how they can result in virtuous and vicious cycles of soil management ability. We show that higher soil management ability is associated with farmers relying to a great extent on farming knowledge acquired within the household, as a result of practices slowly elaborated over the years. Conversely, lower soil management ability is linked to households valuing substantially farming knowledge acquired through neighbors and social gatherings. The present study is the first to formulate the concept of soil management ability and to investigate the effects of the presence and the types of farming knowledge on the soil management ability of smallholder farmers in remote areas. We show that farming knowledge has a primary role on soil fertility and we advise its consideration in agricultural development policies.",2021.0,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,"M.

The AgTech Startup Perspective to Farmers Ex Ante Acceptance Process of Autonomous Field Robots,"Autonomous vehicles not only provide a new impetus in the development of car models in the automotive industry—even in agriculture there has recently been talk of autonomous field robots (AFR). Great expectations are placed on these digital assistants from a wide variety of perspectives. However, it is still unclear whether they will make the transition from market niches to broad-based distribution. Apart from various factors, this depends on user acceptance of this new technology expected by the innovators, since this is likely to be essential for the further development of AFR. For this purpose, the ex ante user acceptance of farmers from the perspective of various AgTech startups with AFR involvement in Europe was investigated in this exploratory and qualitative study. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) served as the basis for the developed interview guideline. In summary, the results confirm that a variety of factors potentially influence farmer acceptance and AFR diffusion from the perspective of AgTech startups, with perceived usefulness being considered the main motivation for using AFR. The interviewed experts believe that AFR will initially be used in crops that have relatively high costs for crop protection treatments before becoming economically attractive for other crops. The basic prerequisite for a successful market launch is an adjustment of the legal framework, which sets standards in relation to AFR and thus, provides security in the production process. The results could support political decision-makers in dealing with this new technology and AFR manufacturers in the promotion of AFR.",2020.0,,Sustainability,"Friedrich Rübcke von Veltheim, H.

Spatially Mediated Peer Effects in the Adoption of Conservation Agriculture Practices,"Abstract This study uses location-specific data to investigate the role of spatially mediated peer effects in farmers’ adoption of conservation agriculture practices. The literature has shown that farmers trust other farmers and one way to increase conservation practice adoption is through identifying feasible conservation practices in neighboring fields. Estimating this effect can help improve our understanding of what influences the adoption and could play a role in improving federal and local conservation program design. The study finds that although spatial peer effects are important in the adoption of conservation tillage and diverse crop rotation, the scale of peer effects are not substantial.",2020.0,Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics,Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics,"D.

Changing agricultural stubble burning practices in the Indo-Gangetic plains: is the Happy Seeder a profitable alternative?,"ABSTRACT Every year after the rice harvest, some 2.5 million farmers in northwest India burn the remaining stubble to prepare their fields for the subsequent wheat crop. Crop residue burning causes massive air pollution affecting millions of people across the Indo-Gangetic Plains. We examine different tillage practices to provide urgently needed empirical evidence on how profitable it is for farmers to adopt no-burn technologies, especially the ‘Happy Seeder’ (HS) which is capable of sowing wheat directly into large amounts of crop residue. Apart from analysing the cost of rice residue management and wheat sowing under conventional-tillage and zero-tillage, we identify factors influencing the adoption of the HS and quantify its impact on wheat yields and –production costs. While we do not find any evidence of a yield penalty, our analysis reveals significant savings in wheat production costs, amounting to 136 USD ha–1. In addition, our analysis shows that the HS saves water and facilitates timely wheat sowing. We conclude that the private benefits of HS use combined with its societal benefits of reducing air pollution and enhancing agricultural sustainability justify particular policy support for its large-scale diffusion, to be supplemented by a stricter enforcement of the ban on residue burning.",2020.0,International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability,International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability,"A.

"The role of the social network structure on the spread of intensive agriculture: an example from Navarre, Spain","Social networks influence decision-making in agricultural landscapes by affecting how farmers access knowledge and resources. However, researchers ignore the disparate structures built to access different kinds of knowledge and resources and the social mechanisms that take place on such farmers’ advice networks. We explored the role of social networks in decision-making among farmers in Navarre (Spain) to understand how and why some practices spread among farming communities. Social network analysis allows us to understand how farmers in this region share both knowledge and resources, and the potential implications of this sharing for the landscape. We find that large-scale farmers undertaking intensive land management are at the core of the network in this region, controlling the flow of knowledge and resources related to farm management, policy, technology, and finance. The central position of these farmers in the social network, and their reputation, is key to the spread of intensive farming practices in the region, which ultimately may lead to homogenization of local agricultural landscapes. Understanding farmer network structures in a context of agricultural intensification can help tease out the social mechanisms, such as farmers joining each other in cooperatives, behind the spread of agricultural practices.",2020.0,Regional Environmental Change,Regional Environmental Change,"Amaia Albizua, E.

"Caste, Social Networks and Variety Adoption","Social networks influence technology diffusion but targeting formal leaders (institutional central nodes) may lead to distributional consequences. This paper analyzes the role of informal social networks in technology diffusion in a socially hierarchical caste-based society. Often, information flow and technology diffusion are constrained by social and economic boundaries where informal nodes such as caste play a very decisive role in everyday life. Proper targeting and dissemination of technology to the marginalized sections of society are very important for their development. We observed that only one-fourth of farmers cultivate newer varieties which include hybrids and recently released high yielding varieties. The results showed that individuals belonging to marginal groups are influential and act as informal leaders when they are the dominant caste in the village. Progressive farmers are found to fail in disseminating new varieties, and targeting influential informal leaders who belong to the dominant caste of the village appears to be a better strategy. Among non-dominant caste members, influential leaders belonging to Other Backward Classes (OBCs) or Scheduled Tribes (STs) are more desirable targets than other caste groups. The more concentrated a network is in terms of its caste composition, the faster will be the spread of any technology.",2020.0,Journal of South Asian Development,Journal of South Asian Development,"I.

Socio-Economic Dimensions of Adoption of Conservation Practices: What Is Needed to Be Done?,"Promoting sustainable agricultural production requires farmers to adopt new technologies such as organic farming to increase the agricultural productivity, while conserving the environment. Adoption and diffusion of new technologies need a long process, as experienced in the past. There are social and economic factors, identified in the literature, and those could cause delays in farmers’ use of new technologies. Hence, technology adoption and diffusion are important policy issues in agriculture. For that reason, this paper provides a literature review including factors influencing the adoption and diffusion of technology in agriculture and aims to contribute to the future studies and policies, especially focusing on the social capital or the social aspects, which are proven not to be analyzed by the previous studies comprehensively. The results show that interaction with neighbors and relatives, and membership in a group or organization, which represent the social aspects, has a positive influence on adoption and diffusion of new technologies. Hence, policy-makers should incorporate the social aspects when designing the policies, such as cost sharing programmes, to promote adoption and diffusion of new technologies.",2020.0,Organic Agriculture,Organic Agriculture,"N.

Revitalizing cultivation and strengthening the seed systems of fonio and Bambara groundnut in Mali through a community biodiversity management approach,"Abstract Fonio (Digitaria exilis (Kippist) Stapf) and Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.) are native crops grown at a small scale in Mali that have potential to support agricultural productivity under climate change. A community biodiversity management approach was explored in this study as a means to reinforce the cultivation of these crops by increasing farmers' access to intraspecific diversity and developing capacities of community institutions for their management. The research involved six communities in Ségou and Sikasso regions. Multiple varieties of fonio (10–12) and Bambara groundnut (8–12) were established in diversity fields in each site over 2 years where farmers engaged in experiential learning over the crop cycle. Significant adoption of fonio and Bambara groundnut was detected in several study sites. The precise drivers of adoption cannot be definitively determined but likely include increased seed access and awareness gained through the diversity field fora, seed fairs and community seed banks. No significant yield advantage was detected for any of the varieties in the diversity fields, which showed variable performance by site and year. The number of varieties registered and managed by community seed banks in each site increased from 1–5 varieties of each crop to 11–12 varieties following the interventions. The number of Bambara groundnut varieties cultivated in farmers' fields also increased, while there was evidence of a slight decline in fonio diversity in some communities. The results of this study can inform efforts to strengthen seed systems and cultivation of neglected and underutilized species in Africa.",2020.0,Plant genetic resources,Plant Genetic Resources: Characterization and Utilization,"A.

Salt-tolerant rice variety adoption in the Mekong River Delta: Farmer adaptation to sea-level rise,"Rice production in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam (MRD) is endangered by sea-level rise and an associated increase in the incidence of salinity intrusion. This paper examines the diffusion of salt tolerant rice varieties in the MRD that were promoted through Consortium for Unfavorable Rice Environments (CURE) activities. Factors associated with adoption of CURE-related varieties are estimated using a random utilty model and a dataset of 800 farm households with rice fields in salinity prone areas of the MRD. Results suggest that there has been widespread adoption of CURE-related varieties in salinity-prone areas. Further, multivariate analysis reveals that environment and location characteristics, rather than household characteristics, are the most important determinants of adoption. In particular, CURE-related varieties are more likely to be adopted in high-salinity-risk areas that are not protected by salinity barrier gates. Neighbhors’ adoption decisions also strongly influence household decisions to adopt CURE-related varieties. The contracting of mechanization, particularly for land preparation and harvest, requires the coordination of village households in timing of planting, harvest and varietal duration. This coordination appears to extend to choice of CURE-related varieties. Finally, CURE-related varieties and other varieties generate similar net revenues in a year with low salinity exposure, suggesting that CURE-related varieties are a low-cost insurance policy against salinity inundation in high risk areas. Combined, these results highlight the need to address complex factors beyond current economic profits, like environment, community choices, and risk mitigation, when designing technologies and policies that support farmer adaptation to climatic change.",2020.0,PLoS ONE,PLoS ONE,"S.

Does training location matter? Evidence from a randomized field experiment in Rural Indonesia,"Informal network helps disseminate agricultural knowledge in the rural area where formal extension is lacking. However, how the interplay between formal training and informal network promotes technology adoption is still under-studied. This paper aims to examine the effects of training locations upon knowledge and adoption of agricultural techniques via strengthened informal and formal social networks. We administer agricultural training of identical contents in farmers’ hometown and in more remote but advanced locations and arrange farmers to travel to the respective locations. Then, we examine locational heterogeneity effects upon conservation and plant-rehabilitation techniques, and social network variables with formal extension services, informal network, and between participants and non-participants. Only farmers trained in the most remote location increase the size and depth of social network with their peers, extension expert, and non-participants upon returning from training. These changes in social networks may encourage them to adopt the technology.

Finally, we employ two real data sets, one from John Snow’s seminal work on cholera epidemics in London in the 1850s and the other one from the United States Department of Agriculture, to validate an approximation of a well-studied network-dependent susceptible-infected-susceptible model.",2020.0,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,"Philip E.

Harvesting Prosperity: Technology and Productivity Growth in Agriculture,"This is the Preliminary Version for a book expected in November 2019. This book documents frontier knowledge on the drivers of agriculture productivity to derive pragmatic policy advice for governments and development partners on reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The analysis describes global trends and long-term sources of total factor productivity growth, along with broad trends in partial factor productivity for land and labor, revisiting the question of scale economies in farming. Technology is central to growth in agricultural productivity, yet across many parts of the developing world, readily available technology is never taken up. We investigate demand-side constraints of the technology equation to analyze factors that might influence producers, particularly poor producers, to adopt modern technology. Agriculture and food systems are rapidly transforming, characterized by shifting food preferences, the rise and growing sophistication of value chains, the increasing globalization of agriculture, and the expanding role of the public and private sectors in bringing about efficient and more rapid productivity growth. In light of this transformation, the analysis focuses on the supply side of the technology equation, exploring how the enabling environment and regulations related to trade and intellectual property rights stimulate Research and Development to raise productivity. The book also discusses emerging developments in modern value chains that contribute to rising productivity. This book is the fourth volume of the World Bank Productivity Project, which seeks to bring frontier thinking on the measurement and determinants of productivity to global policy makers.",2019.0,,,"K.

Learning adaptation to climate change from past climate extremes:,"Conservation agriculture-based wheat production system (CAW) can serve as an ex ante measure to minimize loss due to climate risks, especially the extreme rainfall during the wheat production season in India. This study aims to examine whether farmers learn from their past experiences of exposure to climate extremes and use the knowledge to better adapt to future climate extremes.,The authors used data collected from 184 farmers from Haryana over three consecutive wheat seasons from 2013-2014 to 2015-2016 and multivariate logit model to analyse the driver of the adoption of CAW as an ex ante climate risk mitigating strategies based on their learning and censored Tobit model to analyse the intensity of adoption of CAW as an ex ante climate risk mitigation strategy. Farmer’s knowledge and key barriers to the adoption of CAW were determined through focus group discussions.,The analysis shows that the majority of farmers who had applied CAW in the year 2014-2015 (a year with untimely excess rainfall during the wheat season) have continued to practice CAW and have increased the proportion of land area allocated to it. Many farmers shifted from CTW to CAW in 2015-2016.,While farmers now consider CAW as an ex ante measure to climate risks, a technology knowledge gap exists, which limits its adoption. Therefore, designing appropriate methods to communicate scientific evidence is crucial.,This paper uses three years panel data from 184 farm households in Haryana, India, together with focus groups discussions with farmers and interviews with key informants to assess if farmers learn adaptation to climate change from past climate extremes.",2019.0,,International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management,"J.

The effect of peer observation on consumption choices: evidence from a lab-in-field experiment,"ABSTRACT We investigate the impact of peer observation on consumption decisions using a lab-in-field experiment. Respondents make consumption decisions either alone or under peer observation. We find evidence for peer effects. We are able to study these further by looking into the mechanism and performing detailed heterogeneity analysis. Concerning the mechanisms, we find evidence for an information channel. Further, we show that the consumption choice is influenced by how many people made the same decision previously, but not by who those people are, hence finding evidence of a psychological channel. Respondents with higher cognitive ability are less susceptible to peer effects, while people living in small villages are more susceptible.",2019.0,Applied Economics,Applied Economics,"Antonia Grohmann, Sahra Sakha",10.1080/00036846.2019.1638499,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36a099a5e7da086092745647d1cdb27066b0de79,46.0,8.0,0.0,"['Economics', 'Psychology']","[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Psychology', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00036846.2019.1638499?needAccess=true,,2019-08-04,True,True,matches theoretical benchmark,ambiguous,mixed evidence,risk mitigated through networks,suggests partial intervention,sustained over time,neutral
"Can women's self‐help groups improve access to information, decision‐making, and agricultural practices? The Indian case","Abstract Effective agricultural extension is key to improving productivity, increasing farmers’ access to information, and promoting more diverse sets of crops and improved methods of cultivation. In India, however, the coverage of agricultural extension workers and the relevance of extension advice is poor. We investigate whether a women's self‐help group (SHG) platform could be an effective way of improving access to information, women's empowerment in agriculture, agricultural practices, and production diversity. We use cross‐sectional data on close to 1,000 women from five states in India and employ nearest‐neighbor matching models to match SHG and non‐SHG women along a range of observed characteristics. We find that participation in an SHG increases women's access to information and their participation in some agricultural decisions, but has limited impact on agricultural practices or outcomes, possibly due to financial constraints, social norms, and women's domestic responsibilities. SHGs need to go beyond provision of information to changing the dynamics around women's participation in agriculture to effectively translate knowledge into practice.",2019.0,Agricultural Economics,"Agricultural Economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","K.

Direct and Spillover Effects of Agricultural Technology Adoption Programs: Experimental Evidence from the Dominican Republic,"This paper estimates the impact of an agricultural technology adoption program on agricultural production and income using an experimental approach. The context of analysis is the Program for the Support of Innovation in Agricultural Technology (PATCA II) implemented in the Dominican Republic. The program aimed to increase the agricultural productivity and income of smallholder farmers by encouraging the adoption of a technology. We exploit a two-stage randomized experiment conducted at the geographic and farmer levels to estimate the effects of adopting improved pasture and irrigation technologies. To measure the effectiveness of the program, we combined rich microeconomic data obtained from a comprehensive household survey with administrative data to measure both direct and spillover effects. The sample includes 2,499 farmers, including direct beneficiaries, indirect beneficiaries, controls, and farmers within the social network of direct beneficiaries. We find different patterns of adoption and significant impacts on production-related outcomes for both of the technologies analyzed. The results show adoption of improved pastures increased agricultural income and that the effects intensify over time. In the case of irrigation, treatment had adverse effects on total household income and agricultural production; however, there is evidence of a change in the production portfolio of program beneficiaries from temporary to permanent crops as a function of time of exposure to the technology. Whereas irrigation can be implemented immediately after treatment, income benefits take time to materialize, for instance, as permanent crops reach the initial point of harvest or maturity. These results imply the existence of a dynamic learning-by-doing process. Also, the assessment of indirect or spillover effects did not validate the hypotheses that knowledge spillovers might take place among farmers in close geographical and social proximity to program beneficiaries. The results present evidence that liquidity constraints are critical determinants of technology adoption for smallholder farmers in the Dominican Republic.",2019.0,,,"Julián Aramburu, Lucas Figal Garone, A.

Education Spillovers in Farm Productivity: Revisiting the Evidence,"
 This paper exploits the social organization of India to revisit the question of education spillovers in farm productivity. The fact that social interactions mainly occur within castes in rural India provides tools to show that the observed correlation between farm productivity and neighbors’ education is likely to be a spillover effect. In particular, there are no cross-caste and no cross-occupation effects, which underlines that, under specific assumptions, which are stated and explored in the paper, the education of neighbors does not capture the effect of group unobservables. This evidence is complemented by separate estimations by crops, which show results that are consistent with education spillovers.

Short-term impacts included reductions in stored grain losses due to improved silos and increase in household savings due to increased participation in savings groups.

Adoption of High-Yielding Groundnut Varieties: The Sustainability of a Farmer-Led Multiplication-Dissemination Program in Eastern Uganda,"This study examines the adoption of high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of groundnut by smallholders in eastern Uganda. The primary focus of this work is the analysis of the sustainability of impacts from a regional farmer-led HYV dissemination and multiplication program. Data collected in 2014 is used to determine the lasting impact of the program conducted a decade prior, from 2001 to 2004. The structure of the data, which includes a treatment and 2-part control group, is critical to the identification of project impacts, measured as groundnut land allocation to groundnut HYVs (%). Fractional regression, propensity score matching and instrumental variable techniques are utilized to address potential bias from model specification, selection, and endogeneity. We find that, on average, participating households allocated 21% more of their land in groundnuts to HYVs relative to controls. Diffusion of program benefits through spillover is revealed by statistically significant differences in mean adoption between neighbor and non-neighbor controls, such that benefits are transferred from participants to their neighbors but not to the non-neighbor control group. We also find that, because of seed saving practices, the average yield for HYVs decreased over time to levels below those obtained from landrace varieties. Thus, the program effectively aided in information dissemination and technology transfer within rural communities. However, additional knowledge transfer is critical to the sustainability of food security outcomes among participant farmers.",2018.0,,Sustainability,"J. Jelliffe, B. Bravo‐Ureta, C. Deom, D.

Social Interactions and Spillover Effects in Chinese Family Farming,"Abstract This paper aims to test the effects of social interaction and input spillovers on the agricultural performance of family farms in mixed paddy rice production (organic and conventional farming). Using survey panel data from a Chinese village, we adopt a Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) derived from spatial econometrics to disentangle the social interaction effect from spillover effects and to control for technological heterogeneities. Our analysis reveals a negative social interaction effect indicating that an increase in the yield of neighbouring plots leads to a decrease in the yield of the plot itself. We also find input spillovers. Labour, capital costs, water and organic pesticides have positive spillovers while external nutrients (nitrogen and phosphate) have negative spillover effects. Our study thus calls for a better understanding of social interactions and spillover effects among farmers in the promotion of sustainable family farming.",2018.0,,The Journal of Development Studies,"Huanxiu Guo, S.

Zero-tillage is a proven technology for sustainable wheat intensification in the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains: what determines farmer awareness and adoption?,"In India, there is increasing recognition among policy-makers of the largely untapped potential of the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) for meeting state- and national-level food needs. Zero-tillage (ZT) is a proven technology for enhancing wheat productivity and, hence, food security in the IGP, while reducing production costs – a ‘win-win’ scenario that should support rapid technology scaling even though adoption remains modest to date. In order to inform policies and derive recommendations for a more effective extension strategy, this study investigated determinants of ZT adoption in the Eastern IGP using a random sample of 1000 wheat-growing households from Bihar, stratified by ZT adoption status. We corrected for potential non-exposure bias by using a two-stage estimation procedure that differentiates between factors affecting farmers’ awareness of ZT and those affecting adoption conditional on awareness. Owing to the relatively nascent stage of ZT diffusion in the area, we emphasized the role of information in the adoption process, including social networks, whereby we allowed for endogenous and exogenous network effects. Only 44% of sample households knew about ZT technology, and there was substantial scale bias in favor of larger scale farmers both with respect to awareness and adoption. Both the adoption behavior and characteristics of the respondents’ network members influenced their own awareness and adoption of ZT, particularly among farmers in the smallest landholding tercile. Farmers valued the time-saving potential of ZT, especially under conditions of increasingly unreliable monsoon rains resulting in a delayed rice crop and, consequently, late establishment of wheat which reduces yield. The fact that most farmers accessed ZT via custom-hire services was accounted for in the model, and the importance of proximate service providers confirmed. We conclude that there is need for further awareness-raising campaigns for ZT technology, whereby, apart from mass media, agricultural extension should use contact farmers belonging to different social strata for effective within-village diffusion of messages, especially to the poorer farmers. The social inclusiveness of ZT use can be enhanced by supporting the emergence of more ZT service providers and by developing business models that lower the transaction costs of servicing smaller farms.",2017.0,Food Security,Food Security,"A.

What Does Literature Say About the Determinants jig of Adoption of Agricultural Technologies by Smallholders Farmers,"Understanding the determinants of adoption of agricultural technologies is essential in planning and executing technology related programmes for meeting the challenges of food production in developing countries. This study therefore extensively reviewed the various factors influencing adoption of agricultural technology among smallholder farmers. Results of the findings show that changes in technology adoption are associated with changes in the economic situation of the country, financial status of farm households and the net gain from adopting the technology, access to credit, access to information, travel cost, characteristics of the technology, scale of operation of the farmers, income, cultural norms and values, social network and human specific factors. The findings will be useful to technology developers, disseminators, and the end users (farmers). To increase the likelihood of adoption of the modern agricultural technologies by smallholders, policy makers should make credit accessible to farmers without gender discriminations, make information about the technology available via extension services, advice farmers to improve their educational level and carry the end users along while developing the technology.",2017.0,,,Obayelu Ae,10.19080/ARTOAJ.2017.06.555676,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8c3220a8ca49e30448dc88dac36bccd166af199b,53.0,27.0,1.0,['Engineering'],"[{'category': 'Engineering', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://juniperpublishers.com/artoaj/pdf/ARTOAJ.MS.ID.555676.pdf,['Review'],2017-04-21,True,True,matches theoretical benchmark,ambiguous,strong evidence,risk mitigated through networks,suggests effective intervention,sustained over time,optimistic
Effects of farmers’ social networks on knowledge acquisition: lessons from agricultural training in rural Indonesia,"Agricultural information is transferred through social interactions; therefore, ties to agricultural informants and network structures within farmers’ local neighborhoods determine their information-gathering abilities. This paper uses a spatial autoregressive model that takes account of spatial autocorrelation to examine such network connections, including friendship networks and advice networks, upon farmers’ knowledge-gathering abilities during formal agricultural training. We found that peer advice networks are important to support knowledge-gathering activities, while friendship networks are not. Further examination of network structures confirms that farmers who occupy a central position in their local neighborhood networks are found to perform better in learning outcomes to some extent, indicating that local network position is positively related to problem-solving ability in an unknown environment outside their locale.",2017.0,,Journal of Economic Structures,"Ayu Pratiwi, A.

Knowledge flows and linkage with universities: the vision of Mexican farmers,"This paper is about the linkage between academia and the productive sector in agriculture, focusing on the farmers’ point of view regarding this linkage. It also explores another dimension of knowledge transfer: the links that farmers establish with their peers to share the knowledge they acquire. Two research questions guided this study: (1) What characteristics influence the propensity of a farmer to engage in direct links with researchers? and (2) What characteristics influence the propensity of a farmer to share (transfer) knowledge with other farmers? This paper is based on original micro data obtained from a survey of Mexican farmers in 2011. The Mexican case is interesting for different reasons: it is a large country with large scientific capacities in the agricultural sciences; there is a large number of small farmers living in rural areas—both commercial and subsistence, and agro exports make a contribution to the export structure. Hence, more knowledge flows are needed for the development process. The research questions are approached through a model with a binary dependent variable to analyse the variables that explain the likelihood that a farmer establishes links directly with researchers, and a model with a multinomial distribution in order to observe the determinants of knowledge transfers made by farmers among their peers. The main finding is that training, participation in farmer organisations and the geographical location matter to explain the probability that a farmer establishes links with researchers. Concerning to the propensity of knowledge sharing with other farmers, belonging to organizations that include a variety of agents related to the innovation process and a set of idiosyncratic factors specific to the region (e.g. a more communal type of culture) are relevant for this matter.",2016.0,,Brazilian Journal of Science and Technology,"G.

Various agricultural techniques have been developed as components of food security interventions, but their effectiveness in addressing food insecurity in part depends upon farmers’ abilities to adopt these techniques. In this paper we present the results of a social network analysis that tracked the flow of information on fertilizer microdosing from our Project Research team (PRs) to Demonstration Farmers (DFs), and from DFs to other Village Farmers (VF) in the village of Koumagou B in northwest Benin. Our findings indicate that both adoption and project awareness of microdosing were low following two years of field trails. Overall, the DFs failed to spread information or promote learning over the trial period, with only 3 of 20 DFs diffusing knowledge to a significant degree (i.e., out-degree >5). After 2 years of trials, the efforts of PRs and DFs were insufficient to mobilize the network to adopt the microdosing technique.",2016.0,,Sustainable Agriculture Research,"D. Natcher, E.

The Role of Social Network and Regional System in Maintaining Livelihood Security of Smallholder Farmers in Central Kenya,"Taking smallholder settlements constituting a relatively compact set of two newly settled villages adjacent Northeastern Slopes of Aberdare, Central Kenya as the main research field, the study: investigates the migration patterns, kinship relations and emerging associational life in the study sites; explores the social networks underpinning the exchange and sharing of information and knowledge by the smallholder farmers; and illuminates the functioning of the regional system driven by local-level area differences arising from ecological gradient of a mountain slope. It draws from both qualitative and quantitative data collected from field surveys between 2007 and 2009. Additional field work was conducted intermitted between 2010 and 2012. Findings reveal that lack of land and the ensuing process of migration led to geographical dispersal of household members and breakdown of common household residence formerly a basis for primary bonds and cohesiveness of the kinship system. Thus, kinship relations have weakened and in their place emerged new associational life at the destination areas for coping with and adapting to uncertainties in the new environment. These local-based associations in the new settlements have Original Research Article Kauti; AJAEES, 8(3): xxx-xxx, 2016; Article no.AJAEES.20368 2 replaced the functions of kinship, market and the state in securing livelihoods for the smallholders. Findings on social networks using the case of seed sources information sharing attest to the fact that, farmers are less dependent on social relations in provision of crop varieties and livestock breeds and are highly dependent on market mechanism, an evidence of farmer’s exposure to variable market forces. However, they are continuously engaged in social learning process. The functioning of the regional system revealed a complementary relationship among the studied settlements especially during crisis times such as drought whereby upland farmers have economic, social, and ecological relationships with lowland farmers. Even though the study is limited to the local scope, it provides a basis for designing policies aimed at rural livelihood security improvement and informs and facilitates targeting of outside interventions such as food security programs which can be built on existing social networks and regional system.",2016.0,,"Asian Journal of Agricultural Extension, Economics and Sociology",M.

Quality and Accountability in Healthcare Delivery: Audit Evidence from Primary Care Providers in India,"This paper presents direct evidence on the quality of health care in low-income settings using a unique and original set of audit studies, where standardized patients were presented to a nearly representative sample of rural public and private primary care providers in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Three main findings are reported. First, private providers are mostly unqualified, but they spent more time with patients and completed more items on a checklist of essential history and examination items than public providers, while being no different in their diagnostic and treatment accuracy. Second, the private practices of qualified public sector doctors were identified and the same doctors exerted higher effort and were more likely to provide correct treatment in their private practices. Third, there is a strong positive correlation between provider effort and prices charged in the private sector, whereas there is no correlation between effort and wages in the public sector. The results suggest that market-based accountability in the unregulated private sector may be providing better incentives for provider effort than administrative accountability in the public sector in this setting. While the overall quality of care is low both sectors, the differences in provider effort may partly explain the dominant market share of fee-charging private providers even in the presence of a system of free public healthcare.",2015.0,,Political Economy: Government Expenditures & Related Policies eJournal,"Jishnu Das, A.

Seeing is Believing? Evidence from an Extension Network Experiment,"Farmers' adoption of existing, improved techniques is a central challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa. Extension agents (EAs) are commonly used to disseminate agricultural techniques and technologies. There is no evidence on what activities and incentive mechanisms can make extension services work for farmers. Within an existing extension network in Mozambique, we compare di usion of sustainable land management (SLM) practices in the classic training and visit (TV and (2) a contact farmer (CF) in each community. Yet, the structure of the extension network implemented by the project does not necessarily guarantee a ow of information from CFs to farmers. The GoM worked with a team of researchers from the World Bank and IFPRI to use the MSDVP as a learning vehicle and set up a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to test the e ectiveness of providing a centralized, direct training and performance-based incentives to CFs in boosting farmers' adoption of sustainable land practices (SLM). The design of the evaluation consists of 3 overlaid treatment arms: (1) the revised TV (2) additional women are designated to receive direct SLM training; and (3) additional performance-based incentives for CFs. The various treatment arms were randomly assigned at the village level (150 treatment, 50 control), using a strati ed procedure at the district level.

"Social Capital, Network Effects, and Savings in Rural Vietnam",Information failures are a major barrier to formal financial saving in low-income countries. We explore the extent to which social capital in rural Vietnam plays a role in increasing formal savings where knowledge gaps exist. Social capital is defined as information sharing and the elimination of information asymmetries through active participation in the Women's Union. We consider high- and low-quality networks in terms of the quality of information transmitted. We find that membership of high-quality networks leads to higher levels of saving in formal financial institutions and saving for productive investments. Our results support a role for social capital in facilitating savings and suggest that transmitting financial information through the branches of the Women's Union could be effective in increasing formal savings at grassroots level. We also conclude that it is important to ensure that the information disseminated is accurate given that behavioral effects are also found in networks with low-quality information.,2014.0,,Economics of Networks eJournal,"C.

Learning Through Noticing: Theory and Experimental Evidence in Farming,"Existing learning models attribute failures to learn to a lack of data. We model a different barrier. Given the large number of dimensions one could focus on when using a technology, people may fail to learn because they failed to notice important features of the data they possess. We conduct a field experiment with seaweed farmers to test a model of ""learning through noticing."" We find evidence of a failure to notice: On some dimensions, farmers do not even know the value of their own input. Interestingly, trials show that these dimensions are the ones that farmers fail to optimize. Furthermore, consistent with the model, we find that simply having access to the experimental data does not induce learning. Instead, farmers change behavior only when presented with summaries that highlight the overlooked dimensions. We also draw out the implications of learning through noticing for technology adoption, agricultural extension, and the meaning of human capital.",2012.0,,Economics of Innovation eJournal,"Rema Hanna, S.

Coupled Information Diffusion–Pest Dynamics Models Predict Delayed Benefits of Farmer Cooperation in Pest Management Programs,"Worldwide, the theory and practice of agricultural extension system have been dominated for almost half a century by Rogers' “diffusion of innovation theory”. In particular, the success of integrated pest management (IPM) extension programs depends on the effectiveness of IPM information diffusion from trained farmers to other farmers, an important assumption which underpins funding from development organizations. Here we developed an innovative approach through an agent-based model (ABM) combining social (diffusion theory) and biological (pest population dynamics) models to study the role of cooperation among small-scale farmers to share IPM information for controlling an invasive pest. The model was implemented with field data, including learning processes and control efficiency, from large scale surveys in the Ecuadorian Andes. Our results predict that although cooperation had short-term costs for individual farmers, it paid in the long run as it decreased pest infestation at the community scale. However, the slow learning process placed restrictions on the knowledge that could be generated within farmer communities over time, giving rise to natural lags in IPM diffusion and applications. We further showed that if individuals learn from others about the benefits of early prevention of new pests, then educational effort may have a sustainable long-run impact. Consistent with models of information diffusion theory, our results demonstrate how an integrated approach combining ecological and social systems would help better predict the success of IPM programs. This approach has potential beyond pest management as it could be applied to any resource management program seeking to spread innovations across populations.",2011.0,PLoS Comput.

"Trade Costs, Export Development, and Poverty in Rwanda","For Rwanda, one of the poorest countries in the world, trade offers the most effective route for substantial poverty reduction. But the poor in Rwanda, most of whom are subsistence farmers in rural areas, are currently disconnected from markets and commercial activities by extremely high transport costs and by severe constraints on their ability to shift out of subsistence farming. The constraints include lack of access to credit and lack of access to information on the skills and techniques required to produce commercial crops. The paper is based on information from the household survey and a recent diagnostic study of constraints to trade in Rwanda. It provides a number of indicative simulations that show the potential for substantial reductions in poverty from initiatives that reduce trade costs, enhance the quality of exportable goods, and facilitate movement out of subsistence into commercial activities.",2005.0,,New Institutional Economics,"N.

The role of farmer networks in supporting adaptive capacity: Opening the door for innovation and transformation in the Northeastern United States,"This article explores the role of farmer networks in building the adaptive capacity of small and diversified farmers in the Northeastern United States. Previous research suggests that farmers’ networks are the backbone of practical agricultural knowledge systems in the United States, serving as a critical venue where growers exchange and negotiate new ideas. Drawing upon empirical evidence from a regional survey on climate resilience and a series of focus groups conducted in collaboration with 9 farmer organizations from Pennsylvania to Eastern Canadian provinces, this article examines how the emergence of new ideas and agroecological innovations are influenced by geography, network affiliation, and perceived agency. First, we use regression analysis to identify factors that influence the use of no-till on diversified vegetable and berry farms, which is an emerging innovation in this community. Our analysis shows that geography may not be a significant driver of adoption among the population we sampled, which contrasts with previous research on explanatory factors, yet affiliation with certain farmer networks was significant in predicting the use or intended use of the practice. This quantitative analysis is complemented by qualitative data from a series of focus groups in which farmers identify the characteristics of certain networks which support them in addressing new challenges. Farmers identified that networks support them in learning about new ideas, accessing resources, and engaging in creative problem-solving, through facilitation of spaces for exchange with peers and experts and being responsive to their emerging needs.",2023.0,Elem Sci Anth,Elem Sci Anth,"Alissa White, J.

Seed Selection Strategies for Information Diffusion in Social Networks: An Agent-Based Model Applied to Rural Zambia,"The successful adoptionof innovationsdependson theprovisionof adequate information to farmers. In rural areas of developing countries, farmers usually rely on their social networks as an information source. Hence, policy-makers and program-implementers can benefit from social di usion processes to e ectively disseminate information. This study aims to identify the set of farmers who initially obtain information (‘seeds’) that optimises di usion through the network. It systematically evaluates di erent criteria for seed selection, number of seeds, and their interaction e ects. An empirical Agent-Based Model adjusted to a case study in rural Zambia was applied to predict di usion outcomes for varying seed sets ex ante. Simulations revealed that informing farmers with the most connections leads to highest di usion speed and reach. Also targeting village heads and farmers with high betweenness centrality, who function as bridges connecting di erent parts of the network, enhances di usion. An increased number of seeds improves reach, but the marginal e ects of additional seeds decline. Interdependencies between seed set size and selection criteria highlight the importance of considering both seed selection criteria and seed set size for optimising seeding strategies to enhance information di usion.",2020.0,Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation,J.

Social Learning through Social Networks and Technological Appropriation: The Role of Peer Effects in the Adoption and Use of the Internet in Cameroonian Tontines,"This article attempts to verify whether tontines constitute a social learning platform for the appropriation of technology that underlies patterns of adoption and use of the Internet in sub-Saharan Africa. It uses for this purpose a survey of 2650 households in the cities of Douala, Buea and Limbe and employs initially two zero-inflated count data models to highlight the Intensity of the practice of tontines and after, simple probit models to detect the presence of favorable peer effects in the association tontines on the likelihood of adoption and use of the Internet in Cameroonian households. The results show that, while in ROSCA-type tontines social learning is uncertain because of neutral peer effects, in association tontines within socio-professional groups peer effects are positive and reinforce the process of adoption. These results confirm the studies on dissocializing Internet carried in United States and Europe at the beginning of the dynamics of its diffusion. However and more important, the results presented here show that peer effects play positively on social learning and technology appropriation that underlie the adoption and use of the Internet not in tontine of ROSCA-type, but in the tontine envisaged in professional groups according to their propensity to use modern values for jobs.",2013.0,,,G.

Attrition in longitudinal household survey data,"Longitudinal household data can have considerable advantages over much more widely used cross-sectional data. The collection of longitudinal data, however, may be difficult and expensive. One problem that has concerned many analysts is that sample attrition may make the interpretation of estimates problematic. Such attrition may be particularly severe in areas where there is considerable mobility because of migration between rural and urban areas. Many analysts share the intuition that attrition is likely to be selective on characteristics such as schooling and that high attrition is likely to bias estimates made from longitudinal data. This paper considers the extent of and implications of attrition for three longitudinal household surveys from Bolivia, Kenya, and South Africa that report very high per-year attrition rates between survey rounds. Our estimates indicate that (1) the means for a number of critical outcome and family background variables differ significantly between attritors and nonattritors; (2) a number of family background variables are significant predictors of attrition; but (3) nevertheless, the coefficient estimates for “standard” family background variables in regressions and probit equations for the majority of the outcome variables considered in all three data sets are not affected significantly by attrition. Therefore, attrition apparently is not a general problem for obtaining consistent estimates of the coefficients of interest for most of these outcomes. These results, which are very similar to results for developed economies, suggest that for these outcome variables—despite suggestions of systematic attrition from univariate comparisons between attritors and nonattritors, multivariate estimates of behavioral relations of interest may not be biased due to attrition.",2000.0,,,"H.
