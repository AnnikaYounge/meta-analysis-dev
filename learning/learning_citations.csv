Does Providing Free Trial Packs With Demonstration Plots Increase the Adoption of Agricultural Technologies? Cost Effectiveness Evidence From Tanzania,"This study evaluates the effectiveness of the common practice of providing free trial packs alongside demonstration plots managed by local extension agents to promote learning‐by‐doing and increase technology adoption among bean farmers in Tanzania. The experiment randomly assigned some villages to forgo trial packs containing seeds and a seed treatment for 1 year. Adoption data were collected 1 and 4 years after the intervention. Our findings show that trial packs raised program costs by 37.5 times, but did not lead to a significant or cost‐justified increase in adoption. The adoption of improved bean varieties increased from 11% pre‐intervention to 28% 4 years post‐intervention, with no significant difference between villages with and without trial packs. Although trial packs showed potential for specific groups—such as female, more educated farmers, households in farmer groups, and those living closer to demonstration plots or in smaller villages—their overall impact was limited. These results suggest that demonstration plots, a lower‐cost intervention, are more cost‐effective. Trial packs may still hold value when targeted, but their widespread use does not justify the additional costs. This study offers key insights for policymakers and development practitioners seeking to implement scalable, efficient agricultural interventions.",2025.0,Agricultural Economics,Agricultural Economics,"M.

Are less polluting and synergistic farming technologies complementary?,"
 The objective of our paper is to provide an explanation for the lack of joint adoption by farmers of cleaner technologies in banana production, specifically fallow period (FP) and disease-free seedlings (DFS). Our hypothesis is that while these technologies are synergistic from an agronomic and environmental perspective, and thus efficient from a social interest perspective, they are substitutable rather than complementary from a farmer’s private interest perspective. In other words, farmers receive lower returns from adopting both technologies together than from adopting them in isolation. To test this hypothesis, we present a unified empirical framework for assessing complementarity. We estimate a structural model of complementarity that overcomes the unobservable heterogeneity bias found in previous models using a database of 607 banana farmers in the French West Indies. Our results support our hypothesis, showing a substitution effect between FP and DFS rather than a complementarity effect. Moreover, we observe a contrasting profile of adopting farmers: smallholders who are reluctant to change adopt FP, while more specialized farmers who anticipate a pesticide ban adopt DFS. A public policy that promotes joint adoption should compensate smallholders for the cost of the DFS technology, while compensating more productive farmers for leaving their land fallow.",2025.0,Agricultural and Resource Economics Review,Agricultural and Resource Economics Review,"J.

The Role of Cooperatives in Promoting Climate‐Smart Agriculture: Panel Evidence From Ethiopia,"Climate change threatens the livelihood of millions of smallholder farmers in Sub‐Saharan Africa and elsewhere. This paper investigates whether cooperatives could promote climate‐smart agriculture among their members and, through spillover effects on nonmembers in their villages, among their communities at large. For this purpose, we use panel data collected among smallholder farm households in Ethiopia. We find that (i) cooperative membership is positively associated with the number of adaptation practices adopted by farm households; (ii) this association increases with the number of cooperatives of which farm households are members; and (iii) nonmembers in villages with cooperatives adopt more adaptation practices than farm households in villages without cooperatives, although results are statistically significant only for certain types of cooperatives. These results suggest that considering different levels at which climate change adaptation occurs merits greater attention among researchers and policymakers. For example, enhancing the institutional capacity of and creating partnerships with cooperatives could facilitate the implementation of climate change adaptation policies and strategies, including at the farm level.",2025.0,Agricultural Economics,Agricultural Economics,"G.

"How Hiring Agricultural Managers Affect Farmland Quality Protection Behavior in Farmers’ Cooperatives—Evidence Based on the Survey of Cooperatives in Sichuan, China","This paper aims to include the human capital elements of agricultural managers in the decision-making process of farmland quality protection behavior in farmers’ cooperatives in an effort to discuss and explore the relationship between hiring agricultural managers and the implementation of farmland quality protection behavior. Based on the survey questionnaire of 436 planting cooperatives in Sichuan, China, in 2021, the Poisson model and mediating effect model were used to explore the impact and mechanism of hiring agricultural managers on farmland quality protection behavior in farmers’ cooperatives. The empirical results reveal that hiring agricultural managers significantly elevates farmland quality protection behavior in farmers’ cooperatives. Compared to cross-period farmland quality protection behavior, hiring agricultural managers has a greater impact on single-period farmland quality protection behavior. Through the improvement of information technology application level, the farmland quality protection behavior in cooperatives can be elevated by hiring agricultural managers, but standardized management has a masking effect between the two. Accordingly, continuous development and growth of the agricultural manager team encourages cooperatives to establish a standardized system for recruiting farm managers and strengthen the link between farm managers and cooperatives. The training of agricultural managers should be optimized to deepen their mastery of techniques and knowledge and protect the quality of arable land. Material and moral incentives should be provided to encourage farm managers to focus on the long-term development of their cooperatives. The government should be encouraged to establish a platform for sharing information on farmland quality to provide technical support to farm managers to carry out targeted work on farmland quality protection.",2025.0,Land,Land,"Guo-Yan Zeng, Jie-Hao Deng, She-Mei Zhang",10.3390/land14030502,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aa53f0e7513fe184b6e21e39d4db22d4b7b27662,35.0,0.0,0.0,,"[{'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://doi.org/10.3390/land14030502,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",2025-02-28

Effect of artificial intelligence on economic growth in European countries: a symmetric and asymmetric cointegration based on linear and non-linear ARDL approach,"The impact of accelerated advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) on economic development remains a topic of debate in the current era. It is thought by some that AI has the potential to stimulate economic development; however, the precise function of AI remains uncertain. In order to investigate the influence of AI on economic growth in 30 European countries between 2000 and 2021, this study employed both the symmetric (PMG-ARDL) and asymmetric (PMG-NARDL) models. The ARDL model's results suggest that AI has a stimulating effect on economic development. A 0.217% increase in long-term economic growth is associated with an increase in AI. In the NARDL model, the growth of the economy was observed to be increased by 0.026% as a result of positive shocks to the positive AI variable. Conversely, negative shocks were found to have a negative impact, with a decrease of 0.029% in economic growth. It is posited that AI may stimulate economic development by increasing efficiency, promoting economies of scale, enhancing the quality of products and services, and improving working conditions. Furthermore, the study identifies the displacement of employment, the rising costs of training and adaptation, and the expansion of economic and social inequality. To address these challenges, policymakers must facilitate the creation of alternative employment opportunities, promote the development of new AI-driven industries, and implement rehabilitation programs for workers at risk of automation.

Contaminated water spillovers or peer effects? Determinants of disease outbreaks in shrimp farming in Vietnam,"Disease outbreaks are one of the major issues in the aquaculture sector and can lead to significant economic losses. Although the source of the disease is difficult to trace, understanding how it occurs is important to mitigate the problem. A crucial factor that has not received sufficient attention is the presence of spillovers among fish farmers connected by waterways. This study examines the presence of spillovers among shrimp farmers in Southern Vietnam based on primary data. In particular, it quantifies the effects of contaminated water spillovers from one farm to another and the peer effects of farming practices among neighbors. We solve the reflection problem by employing a method developed in social network analyses. The findings indicate that a farmer's practices are affected by their neighbors’ farming practices. Further, the disease outbreak in a farmer's pond is affected by those in their neighbors’ ponds, even after controlling for contextual peer effects and correlated effects. The negative effects of neighbors’ ponds on the probability of disease outbreaks in a farmer's pond may offset the positive effects of the farmer's good farming practices, suggesting the importance of considering neighboring farmers as a group when addressing the issue of disease control.",2024.0,Agricultural Economics,Agricultural Economics,"Aya Suzuki, Susan Olivia, Vu Hoang Nam, Guenwoo Lee",10.1111/agec.12872,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/084c42e57b41a75585906750f3d380cd4c7ac084,61.0,1.0,0.0,,"[{'category': 'Environmental Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12872,['JournalArticle'],2024-12-25

Does the European Union Start-Up Aid Help Young Farmers to Innovate and to Join Networks?,"The endurance and vitality of European agriculture are threatened by the aging of farmers, together with the lack of generational change. The small share of young farmers also impacts on the innovative capacity and competitiveness of the sector. The Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union started addressing the issue long ago by providing financial aid to help young farmers to start up. Over time, the aid increased and packages of measures were set to reinforce the aid and to promote investments, innovations, and networks at the farm level. While the literature focuses on analyzing the effectiveness of the start-up aid in fostering new entries, this paper assumes an original perspective as it seeks to assess whether this aid has actually promoted innovations and networks in the beneficiary farms. The analysis relies on sample data collected in 2021 in Italy and Poland via interviews of 500 farmers under 40 who had entered the sector both with and without the aid. A probit model estimates whether the beneficiaries have a higher probability to innovate and network. Then, the contribution of the aid to the intensity of the adoption of innovations and networks is estimated via an Average Treatment Effect on the Treated model (ATT). Results suggest that the start-up aid increased the adoption of innovations and networks. The ATT indicates that this positive effect holds even after correcting for self-selection bias. By adopting an original perspective, our analysis suggests that the start-up aid for young farmers goes beyond rejuvenating agriculture by fostering innovation at the farm level and by promoting networking, thus enhancing agricultural change. However, farmer behaviors in the two countries are different, suggesting quite complex patterns for the impact of this measure.",2024.0,Agriculture,Agriculture,"Anna Carbone, F.

Do Agricultural stakeholder panels enhance post-harvest loss reduction? Evidence from Malawi,"Post-harvest loss significantly affects food security in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and elsewhere across developing countries. Weak institutional factors like ineffective agricultural extension services in rural communities can exacerbate such problems among smallholder farmers in SSA and other developing countries. Therefore, international development policies have prioritized strengthening rural extension systems to enhance access to effective extension services and thereby enhance food security outcomes like ineffective agriculturalpost-harvest loss reduction among rural households. As such, the US-Agency for International Development supported the Strengthening Agricultural and Nutrition Extension program in Malawi from 2015 to 2021 to improve access to rural extension services by promoting Agricultural Stakeholder Panels (ASPs)—platforms designed to enhance farmer interaction with local extension agents in rural communities and thereby enhance improved access to quality extension services in rural areas. The ASP approach can reduce post-harvest losses for major crops, such as maize. However, rigorous analyses of the effects of ASPs on post-harvest loss reduction remain limited. To address this knowledge gap, we apply recursive bivariate probit regression to primary survey data from 2134 households in Malawi to estimate the effects of the ASP approach on post-harvest loss reduction in 2018. The results show that ASPs reduced post-harvest losses among households by 53%, and a crucial outcome that can improve household food security. The result demonstrates that policies that strengthen rural extension systems can contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals on hunger and food security in rural Malawi and similar contexts.",2024.0,Agriculture &amp; Food Security,Agriculture &amp; Food Security,"Festus O.

Field observation and verbal exchange as different peer effects in farmers’ technology adoption decisions,"Farmers’ adoption of novel technologies is influenced by other farmers’ behavior, a phenomenon known as peer effects. Although such effects have been studied intensively, the literature does not clearly distinguish between those that result (1) from verbal exchanges with other farmers and (2) from field observations, including the application of technology, its outcomes, and field conditions. We extend existing theoretical concepts and hypothesize that verbal information exchanges and field observations are two types of peer effects. Using data from an online survey of German sugar beet farmers’ application of mechanical weeding from early 2022, we find that the likelihood of adopting mechanical weeding increases across all model specifications by around 26%–28% if at least one adopter is known and by approximately 30%–32% if at least one field is observed. The two types of peer effects complement and reinforce each other in explaining adoption decisions. The effects increase with the number of adopters known and fields observed but decrease with larger distances to the observed fields. The findings can support designing extension services and future peer effects research that should consider the distinction between peer effects arising from verbal exchanges and field observations.",2024.0,Agricultural Economics,Agricultural Economics,"Anna Massfeller, Hugo Storm",10.1111/agec.12847,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08d0413eae0e6b409e1d442b199421817a4dc9ad,58.0,1.0,0.0,,"[{'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12847,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",2024-07-08

"Talking water: interplay of gender, trust and expertise in agricultural extension groups in Mendoza, Argentina","
 Stakeholder adaptation is a critical strategy to overcome changing climate patterns worldwide. Still it relies on the speed and effectiveness of information flow to end-users. Research shows that the loss of information in several stages of its spread and learning from peers is more important than the knowledge circulated by extension services. Women’s participation and contribution are supportive and strategic, depending on the level of agreement and the interplay of trust variables within the network. In the arid Andes, agriculture is central and dependent on water management and macroeconomic conditions that shape market prospects, irrigation practices, and stakeholder behavior. Data were collected using the platform of a capacity-building program for organisations of water users in the Diamante and Atuel River basins in Mendoza, Argentina. Social Network Analysis (SNA) contributes to unveiling the cornerstones of information flow by identifying group structures, strong bonds, and bottlenecks in water management systems. In the first step, we evaluated the characteristics (density, centrality, average shortest path, and degree) of the pre-existing relationships and five sub-topic networks. Second, we compare networks containing pre-existing links only with those formed during the lecture. Emphasizing adaptation practices to cope with climate change impacts, the results provide valuable insights into the intricate interplay of gender dynamics, trust, expertise recognition, and discussion patterns within water and agricultural extension groups in Argentina. These insights highlight the ongoing need to promote gender equity, address biases in expertise recognition, and leverage trust for meaningful knowledge exchanges within evolving social contexts. It also reveals the alignment of Argentina's gender performance with similar production setups in Southern America or the Global North, highlighting the universality of challenges and opportunities in fostering inclusive and equitable participation. Our findings indicate that each group within the two river basins exhibits numerous pre-existing links and tends to be less accessible to newcomers, resulting in a shorter average path. Thus, information can spread faster.

"Impact of adoption of better management practices and nutrition-sensitive training on the productivity, livelihoods and food security of small-scale aquaculture producers in Myanmar","Small-scale aquaculture is a major source of food in Myanmar. Beyond its importance for food security and nutrition, small-scale aquaculture contributes to the livelihoods of many rural households and is a potentially valuable strategy for rural development. However, small-scale aquaculture producers have limited access to improved production technologies and information, which hampers the productivity and socioeconomic performance of small-scale aquaculture systems. In this study we assessed the impact of the adoption of better management practices and exposure to nutrition-sensitive training by 379 small-scale aquaculture producers in the Sagaing and Shan regions of Myanmar. We focused on whether and how the exposure to these interventions affected household food security through improvements in productivity and livelihoods. We used Propensity Score Matching to compare the performance of groups that were exposed to the intervention for one or two years, for seven impact variables. Exposure to the intervention had a positive effect for most impact variables, with differentiated effects among variables, group comparisons and regions. In terms of food security, beneficiaries had significantly higher dietary diversity (measured as the Food Consumption Score, FCS), but there were no significant differences for fish self-consumption (measured in kg/week). Longer exposure to the interventions produced significantly higher positive effects across most impact variables for the 2-year beneficiaries compared to 1-year beneficiaries and control groups. Our study suggests that the length of exposure to such interventions can be important in mediating the actual impact of small-scale aquaculture systems on household food security and livelihoods. Sustained help to small-scale producers should be considered in initiatives and development projects seeking to enhance the food security and rural development of small-scale aquaculture systems in Myanmar, and beyond.",2023.0,Food Security,Food Security,"E.

Kano Model Analysis of Digital On-Farm Technologies for Climate Adaptation and Mitigation in Livestock Farming,"In the EU, agriculture contributes significantly to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In Germany, over half of the GHG emissions from agriculture can be directly attributed to livestock farming. To combat the progressing climate change, GHG emissions must be significantly reduced. Digital solutions, particularly decision support systems (DSS), are promising tools to assist livestock farmers in achieving the globally agreed GHG reduction goals. However, there is a lack of studies addressing DSS requirements for reducing GHG emissions in livestock on the farm level. Users’ feedback on technologies can support identifying areas for enhancement and refinement. This study identifies, categorizes, and ranks fourteen DSS features aimed at supporting GHG reduction based on their impact on customer satisfaction. A quantitative online questionnaire using the Kano model surveyed livestock farmers’ satisfaction or dissatisfaction levels with these features. Results gathered from 98 responses across German federal states highlighted the significance of data authority and integrability, with their absence causing dissatisfaction. Multi-target optimization emerged as an attractive feature, positively impacting satisfaction. Connectivity and market perspective, however, appeared indifferent. The findings guide DSS developers in prioritizing attributes crucial for customer satisfaction. It also helps to focus on must-have attributes to preserve customer satisfaction and ensure successful GHG reduction implementation.",2023.0,Sustainability,Sustainability,"Pia Münster, Barbara Grabkowsky",10.3390/su16010268,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c5bd1c8cbc8bb951572dc8f327522353952f9dde,66.0,2.0,0.0,,"[{'category': 'Environmental Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/1/268/pdf?version=1703689944,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",2023-12-27

"Enhancing adaptation to climate change by fostering collective action groups among smallholders in Punjab, Pakistan","Climate change adaptation is increasingly recognized by subsistence farmers in Pakistan. The problem of climate change is severe, and smallholders are often resource constrained when it comes to adapting to it. However, such constraints can be overcome through collective responses. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of collective action among smallholder farmers to determine how it influences local adaptation processes. This study explores the impact of farmer’s collective action groups (CAGs) on adopting climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices in poverty-stricken areas of rural Punjab, Pakistan. The data was collected through a cross-sectional survey, and for the analysis purpose, the Recursive bivariate probit regression (RBP) model was employed. The first stage estimates of RBP models suggest that the farmer’s decision to participate in CAGs is mainly influenced by factors such as education, credit access, climate change risk perception, and peer influence. The second stage estimates showed a positive and significant impact of farmers’ participation in collective action groups on adopting climate change adaptation strategies across all three models. The study concludes that the farmers participating in collective action groups have a higher climate change adaptation level. It is recommended that the pro-poor policies be designed to negate the entry barriers, facilitate the inclusion of the farmers in the collective action groups, and enhance climate change adaptation among smallholders.",2023.0,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,"Awais Jabbar, Wei Liu, Jian Zhang, Yecheng Wang, Qun Wu, Jianchao Peng, Jiyun Liu",10.3389/fsufs.2023.1235726,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22994eeba02c0f681844a928c4bd7fd2c86fa861,94.0,5.0,0.0,,"[{'category': 'Environmental Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Sociology', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1235726/pdf?isPublishedV2=False,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",2023-11-15

Sustainable intensification technologies and farm performance: evidence from smallholder sorghum farmers in Nigeria,"ABSTRACT The empirical literature on plot-level adoption of sustainable intensification technologies (SITs), as a package comprising improved crop varieties and good agronomic management practices is thin for dryland crops, such as sorghum. In this paper, we analyze the adoption and impacts of SITs on sorghum yield and net revenue using data from a sample of 1680 households and 3310 plots in the sorghum belt of Nigeria. Our estimates are based on a multinomial endogenous switching regression, which accounts for observable and unobservable sources of selection bias. We find a relatively low joint adoption of both improved sorghum varieties and good agronomic practices. In addition, we find that the adoption of only improved sorghum varieties and the joint adoption of both improved sorghum varieties and good agronomic practices led to a 56 and 102% increase in sorghum yield, respectively, and an 88 and 82% increase in net revenue, respectively. The yield and net revenue effects indicate that there are considerable missing opportunities that sorghum-producing households can harness through the adoption of SITs. Our findings reveal that policies tailored towards promoting the widespread adoption of SITs can lead to considerable productivity gains and economic returns for smallholder sorghum farmers towards improving their welfare.",2023.0,International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability,International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability,"A.

Impact of Environmental Values and Information Awareness on the Adoption of Soil Testing and Formula Fertilization Technology by Farmers—A Case Study Considering Social Networks,"The irrational application of chemical fertilizer affects agricultural land’s supply capacity and yield quality and may lead to serious agricultural non-point source pollution. Through scientific and accurate fertilization, soil testing and formula fertilization technology (STFFT) can effectively prevent excessive fertilizer use, improve its utilization efficiency, and have significant environmental and economic benefits. Based on evolutionary game theory, this paper constructed an evolutionary game model of farmers’ adoption of STFFT. We used a case study to reveal and verify the influence of farmers’ environmental values, information awareness, and social network on their adoption of STFFT and its mechanism. The findings were as follows: First, there are two optimal stable states in the evolutionary system; namely, all farmers adopt or do not adopt STFFT. Second, environmental values and information awareness positively correlate with farmers’ adoption of STFFT. Third, the strength of social networks can enhance the effectiveness of information awareness and environmental values, encouraging farmers to adopt STFFT. In addition, the social network plays a mediating role and moderating role in the influence of information awareness and environmental values on the farmers’ adoption of STFFT.",2023.0,Agriculture,Agriculture,"Mengling Tian, Ruifeng Liu, Jian Wang, Jiahao Liang, Y.

"The Leveraging of Support by Faith-Based Social Groups in Rural Villages of the Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria","Social networks and social groups are often regarded as being important elements of social capital. The research set out in this paper is designed to explore whether social groups in villages located close to the Nigerian capital city of Abuja seek to lever benefits from the connections (networks) they may have with the government and others in that city. Of special interest is whether there is a significant difference between secular and faith-based social groups in terms of the leveraging of such support. The research builds upon a previous study that employed a questionnaire-based survey of 26 social groups spanning two area councils (ACs; Bwari and Kwali) in the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria followed by a series of in-depth interviews with leaders of the groups (e.g., chairperson, secretary, and treasurer) to explore the findings. The results were analysed using regression and suggest that most groups (14) had sought to lever support from their connections in Abuja. Those more likely to leverage support were registered with their respective ACls, a requirement for accessing credit from formal lenders, and tended to be smaller in size in terms of membership. There was also some suggestion that leverage was more likely with male social groups than female ones. Registration with an AC was more likely for secular groups than religious ones. Religious-based groups in the villages did not see their activities as being ‘project orientated’ and instead regarded their role as being in community support. Social groups cannot be thought of as static and exclusive and the diversity of such groups at the village scale is a source of strength for their communities. The results have important ramifications for those institutions, especially faith-based ones, wishing to work with social groups to help in the design and implementation of development initiatives.",2023.0,Sustainability,Sustainability,"S.

Research on the Rural Environmental Governance and Interaction Effects of Farmers under the Perspective of Circular Economy—Evidence from Three Provinces of China,"As an essential subject of rural environmental governance, farmers’ environmental governance behavior directly affects the level and efficiency of rural environmental governance. In traditional rural society, the characteristics of “acquaintance society”, “circle doctrine”, and “clan society” have led to farmers’ behaviors being influenced and constrained by their surrounding social support and social relations. Therefore, the interaction between farmers will affect the effectiveness of rural environmental governance, and the interaction effect will also affect the implementation of policies in rural environmental governance. In the strategic context of the policy of “building a beautiful and harmonious countryside that is desirable to live and work in” and “promoting green development and harmonious coexistence between human beings and nature” put forward by the 20th National Congress, we follow the principles of Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle from the perspective of circular economy, taking farmers as our research subject. We take the behavior of domestic garbage disposal as an example and, relying on the National Social Science Foundation project, use field research data and refer to neighbor groups and neighboring village groups. We use the Manski model to test the interaction effect of the two groups, analyze the interaction between individual farmers and the interaction between neighboring villages, and, finally, prove that there is an endogenous interaction effect and a situational interaction effect between the neighbor group and neighboring villages. Endogenous interaction effects, contextual interaction effects, and association effects exist between neighbor groups, while only contextual interaction effects and association effects exist between neighboring village groups.

Existing research related to fertilizer use efficiency ignores the impact of famers’ social networks, which can significantly affect the fertilizer use and its efficiency. This paper analyzed the impact of social networks on fertilizer use efficiency and the mediator effect of green fertilization technology adoption, based on the calculation of fertilizer use efficiency of 569 kiwifruit farmers in Shaanxi province of China surveyed in 2021 by using stochastic frontier method. The results show that the FUE of kiwifruit production ranged within 0.1027–0.9945, with an average value of 0.333, which showed great variability, and fertilizer input had an average 66.7% reduction potential without reducing output. Social networks and its four dimensions all had a significant positive impact on FUE, in which network trust and network learning had a greater impact on FUE. Farmers’ adoption of green fertilization technology played a positive mediator effect in the process of social networks influencing their fertilizer use efficiency, which was mainly promoted by network trust and learning. Farmers’ experience in agricultural production, joining the cooperative, the quantity of village agricultural supply points had a significant positive impact on fertilizer use efficiency, while age and gentle of the head of household had a significant negative impact of fertilizer use efficiency. Planting scale had a U-shape impact on FUE. Policies aimed at improving FUE and reducing non-point source pollution should, therefore, focus on improving the social networks of farmers, especially young farmers, strengthening network trust, promoting network learning, network reciprocity and network interaction, strengthening the research and development and extension of green fertilization technology, encouraging farmers to join agricultural cooperative, improving village production conditions, guiding sustainable agricultural production.",2023.0,Environmental science and pollution research international,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Fangyuan Chang, Li Liu, Yu Wang, Jundi Liu, Xiuguang Bai",10.1007/s11356-023-29508-3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/603eceabbd1e4c76b9f9d634fca864f5e77555b9,69.0,9.0,0.0,['Medicine'],"[{'category': 'Medicine', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Environmental Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2710431/latest.pdf,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",2023-09-01

How Does Capital Endowment Impact Farmers’ Green Production Behavior? Perspectives on Ecological Cognition and Environmental Regulation,"Enhancing rural ecological protection and promoting the adoption of environmentally-friendly agricultural production practices largely depend on the implementation of green production methods by farmers. This research paper focuses on the green production behavior of farmers in Hainan Province, China, drawing insights from survey responses provided by 543 farmers. The study examines how farmers’ capital endowment, ecological cognition, and environmental regulation impact their multiple green production practices, using the ordered probit model, mediation effect model, and moderation effect model for analysis and further applying the Ivoprobit_CMP, PSM, and other methods for endogeneity treatment and a robustness test. The study reveals several key findings. Firstly, only a small proportion of farmers consistently adopt green production practices throughout various stages of agricultural production. Secondly, the research shows that capital endowment, including natural, economic, human, and social capital, has a significant influence on farmers’ green production behavior. Thirdly, the study finds that ecological cognition plays a crucial role in mediating the relationship between capital endowment and its dimensions (human and social capital) and the adoption of green production practices. Additionally, the research discovers that environmental regulation positively moderates the relationship between ecological cognition and farmers’ green production behavior. Finally, the research indicates that factors such as ethnicity, fluctuations in agricultural production, and the location of the village agricultural waste collection site are all significant determinants of farmers’ engagement in green production practices. The study also identifies significant regional disparities in farmers’ adoption of green production practices. To address the issue of farmers’ low adoption of green production practices, the paper recommends promoting the overall green transformation of the entire agricultural production process. This can be achieved by enhancing farmers’ capital endowment in multiple dimensions and improving their ecological cognition through various channels. Additionally, creating a supportive external environment that aligns with green production practices is deemed critical.",2023.0,Land,Land,"Xuezhen Xu, Fang Wang, Tao Xu, S.

Farming Under Drought: An Analysis of the Factors Influencing Farmers’ Multiple Adoption of Water Conservation Practices to Mitigate Farm-Level Water Scarcity,"
 This paper investigates the factors that drive farmers’ simultaneous adoption of six water conservation practices (WCPs) and the intensity of their adoption. We estimate farmers’ adoption of these WCPs with a multivariate probit model, and for the intensity of their adoption, an ordered probit model is estimated. Our results show that gender, age, education, and farm size (among other factors) influence the probability and extent of adoption of WCPs. Furthermore, combinations like drip and/or sprinkler irrigations and cover cropping, drip and/or sprinkler irrigations and intercropping (among others) are complements, suggesting the bundling of these WCPs.",2023.0,Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics,Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics,"A.

"Household and plot-level survey data on adoption, outcomes, and perceptions of early sown wheat and zero tillage in Northwest India","This study collected evidence on the use of early sown wheat varieties and complementary zero tillage technologies in Northwest India. Detailed information on farmers’ knowledge, adoption decisions, personal experience, and perceptions of early sown wheat and zero tillage technologies were collected at the household level using different survey tools. Additional information on agricultural practices during the Rabi Season 2021/22 were collected at the plot level and geocoded. Overall, the dataset comprises responses from 1206 wheat farmers in 70 villages across 7 districts in Punjab and Haryana that were collected between September and October 2022. The villages were selected using stratified random sampling based on a sampling frame of 1722 communities that had been identified as predominantly wheat growing areas based on remote-sensing data from satellite images. The dataset provides rich information that may be used for assessing the diffusion and impact of recently developed wheat varieties designed for early sowing, identifying barriers to the wider adoption of these technologies, and informing policy making aimed at improving adoption and usage decisions of agricultural innovations.",2023.0,Scientific Data,Scientific Data,"Dominik Naeher, Basma H.

Pathways from information to the adoption of conservation agriculture practices in Malawi and Tanzania,"Abstract To reduce agriculture's carbon, land and water footprint, the diffusion of conservation farming methods is one commonly cited proposition. Yet the process of translating available information on new conservation farming methods into farmers' practices is often a black box in many studies. This understanding is critical to inform strategies for scaling these complex, knowledge-intensive, but necessary practices for improving agriculture's resource and climate balance sheet. By implementing a series of mediation analysis using data from 700 households in Malawi and 930 households in Tanzania, this study examines how an improved understanding of conservation agriculture (CA) principles is an important mediator in the pathway from extension contact to the adoption of two of the CA practices examined. For the adoption of conservation tillage, the share of the mediated treatment effect was in the 31.5–34.4% range, while it was 31.6–46.9% for the adoption of soil cover (mulching). Our results suggest that unless learning from external sources strongly correlates with improved farmers' technical understanding of new farming practices, private learning by doing must be a critical adjunct to other avenues of learning. Beyond the basic promotional goals, improving farmers' technical know-how needs to be the centerpiece of holistic efforts in support of conservation farming and similar knowledge-intensive practices necessary for agriculture's sustinability goals.",2023.0,Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems,Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems,"P.

Policy incentives for smallholder adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices,"There is a large and growing literature on the potential use of policy instruments for stimulating the adoption of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) practices amongst smallholders. The objective of this article is to review and understand how the array of potential policy incentives can serve as mechanisms for enhancing adoption and upscaling of potential CSA practices by small-scale farmers in low-income countries. The review follows a matrix approach capturing where specific CSA practices (rows) are supported by typical policy instruments (columns) for enhancing widespread adoption. We first identify six key CSA practices, namely water management, soil and nutrient management, crop tolerance to stress, agroforestry and intercropping, crop rotation and mixed systems, and pest and disease management. Then we discuss the impact of those typical policy instruments, namely market prices, taxes and subsidies, land rights, rural finance, training and information, and certification and labeling. The review finds that most studies on this subject have a rather narrow focus on functional properties of a specific policy instrument and a particular CSA practice, thereby ignoring substitution, complementary or conditional effects between policy measures and CSA practices. Consequently, previous studies identify few incentives, particularly effective on their own. Wider perspectives on impact pathways point to the importance of sequencing and scaling for enhancing farmers' CSA adoption. We therefore advocate for more integrated approaches that also consider indirect effects of policy instruments on CSA adoption and pursue their systematic anchoring through successful policies that enhance widespread adoption.",2023.0,Frontiers in Political Science,,"Marcel van Asseldonk, E.

"Financial development, growth and productivity","Purpose In this paper, the heterogeneity of the linkages among financial development, productivity and growth across income groups is emphasized.Design/methodology/approach An empirical analysis is conducted with an illustrative sample of 130 economies over the period 1991–2019 and classified into four subsamples: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), developing, least developed and net food importing developing countries. Forecast error variance decompositions and panel vector auto-regressive estimations are computed, with insightful findings.Findings Higher levels of output stimulate the economic development in the agricultural sector, mainly via the productivity channel and, in the most developed economies, also through access to credit. Differently, in developing and least developed economies, the role of access to credit is marginal. The findings have practical implications for stakeholders involved in the planning of long-run investments. In less developed economies, priorities should be given to investments in technology and innovation, whereas financial markets are more suited to boost the development of the agricultural sector of developed economies.Originality/value The authors conclude on the credit–output–productivity nexus and contribute to the literature in (at least) three ways. First, they assess how credit access, agricultural output and agricultural productivity are jointly determined. Second, they use a novel approach, which departs from most of the case studies based on single-country data.

"The adoption of conservation practices in the Corn Belt: the role of one formal farmer network, Practical Farmers of Iowa","Substantial evidence has shown that involvement in peer-to-peer farming networks influences whether a farmer decides to try a new practice. Formally organized farmer networks are emerging as a unique entity that blend the benefits of decentralized exchange of farmer knowledge within the structure of an organization providing a variety of sources of information and forms of engagement. We define formal farmer networks as farmer networks with a distinct membership and organizational structure, leadership that includes farmers, and an emphasis on peer-to-peer learning. This study complements existing ethnographic research on the benefits of organized farmer networking by examining farmers in one longstanding formal farmer network, Practical Farmers of Iowa. Using a nested, mixed-method research design, we analyzed survey and interview data to understand how participation and forms of engagement in the network are associated with the adoption of conservation practices. Responses from 677 farmers from a regular member survey disseminated by Practical Farmers of Iowa in 2013, 2017, and 2020 were pooled and analyzed. GLM binomial and ordered logistic regression results indicate that greater participation in the network, particularly through in-person formats, has a strong and significant association with greater adoption of conservation practices. Logistic regression results show that building relationships in the network is the most important variable for predicting whether a farmer reported adopting conservation practices as a result of participation in PFI. In-depth interviews with 26 surveyed member farmers revealed that PFI supports farmers to adopt by providing information, resources, encouragement, confidence building, and reinforcement. In-person learning formats were more important to farmers relative to independent formats because they were able to have side conversations with other farmers, ask questions, and observe results. We conclude that formal networks are a promising way to expand the use of conservation practices, particularly through targeted efforts to increase relationship building in the network through face-to-face learning opportunities.",2023.0,Agriculture and Human Values,Agriculture and Human Values,"L.

The Fruits (and Vegetables) of Crime: Protection from Theft and Agricultural Development,"Fear of crime is a concern in developing countries where weak states do not provide strong rule of law. In this paper I show that fear of theft causes small-scale farmers to alter their production decisions, imposing pervasive indirect costs. I use evidence from a cluster-randomized field experiment in Kenya to show that improved protection of farms impacts planting and time use decisions, as well as crop yields. I randomly allocated subsidized watchmen to farmers in Kenya, reducing their perceived risk of theft. Farmers offered watchmen were 14 percentage points more likely to have crops they grew for the first time or grew on more land as a result of improved security, and also reported selling more of their crops off-farm. In addition, the value of farm output per acre increased by 15% of the control mean. The intervention significantly reduced angry disputes among neighbours, as well as self-reported theft experienced by nearby farmers within the village, with no significant evidence of crime displacement to nearby control villages. Despite these benefits, this intervention does not appear to be optimal for an individual farmer. Fear of crime is, therefore, a pervasive hindrance to agricultural development and suggests a potential role for policy interventions to improve rule of law.",2023.0,Social Science Research Network,SSRN Electronic Journal,J.

PENGARUH TINGKAT PENDIDIKAN TERHADAP PEREKONOMIAN PENDUDUK INDONESIA,"Several theories, including the theory of human capital, the theory of distributive social status, and the theory of class growth, have demonstrated the importance of education in driving economic growth. Likewise, studies from various countries have shown the importance of education as an initiator of economic growth. In this context there are many references that can be an indication that the level of education is a determining factor in the economy, or it can be interpreted that the economy has different abilities according to the level of education to see and observe from various perspectives, one of which is salary. , work life achieved, societal views and many other benchmarks which are evidence that educational attainment can affect an individual's finances. The purpose of this research is to find out the differences in the level of the economy based on the level of education in Indonesia. The next objective is to determine the percentage of prosperity achieved at each level of education in Indonesia.

Surveying the Evidence on Sustainable Intensification Strategies for Smallholder Agricultural Systems,"Food demand is projected to increase significantly over the coming decades. Sustainable intensification (SI) is essential to meet this demand. SI is particularly important in smallholder systems, yet to date it remains unclear what the most promising SI strategies are to increase food production and farmer incomes at scale. We review the literature on SI to identify the most promising strategies, as manifest in replicated findings of favorable causal impacts. Adoption of improved cultivars generated the largest, most consistent, positive yield and economic outcomes. Two agroecological practices, push-pull systems and the System of Rice Intensification, also repeatedly led to large positive impacts. These strategies have considerable potential to scale to reach more than 50% of smallholder farmers who plant staple crops. Significant barriers to adoption remain, however, and identifying ways to overcome barriers to scale these successful strategies will be critical to meeting Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 2 by 2030.

Are there gender differences in aspirations formation in rural Ethiopia?,"This paper examines gender differences in aspirations formation (with respect to income, wealth, and children’s education) using survey data collected from sample households in rural Ethiopia. Results show evidence of upward looking income aspirations for both men and women, and upward looking wealth aspirations only for women, while the social effect of aspirations to children’s education appears to be weak for both sexes. Even though men (in general) appear to have higher aspirations than women, the differences in parameter estimates across gender are not statistically significant, suggesting that the gender-differentiated effect of social drivers on aspirations is limited. The results imply that policies and interventions that raise incomes in the village may increase income aspirations of both men and women, while efforts to enhance women’s wealth aspirations may be more effective if they improve wealth of women in the village. Since our sample is relatively small with limited geographic coverage, findings of this study could be context specific.

Credit constraint and agricultural technology adoptions: evidence from Ethiopia,"PurposeThis paper investigates constraints to yield enhancing technology adoptions, highlighting credit using data pooled from the first three waves of the Ethiopian socio-economic surveys.Design/methodology/approachDirect elicitation methodology is used to identify household's non-price credit rationing status. The panel selection model specified to examine causal effects of credit constraint on adoption variables allows us to tackle self-selection into adoptions and potential endogeneity of credit constraint while controlling for unobserved heterogeneity in both the selection and main equations.FindingsResults show that about 54% of sample households face credit rationing, predominantly demand-side risk rationing. There is a negative association between measures of credit constraint status and adoption variables. The effect is stronger when the demand-side credit rationing is accounted for and when within household variation in credit constraint status overtime is considered as opposed to across constrained and unconstrained households.Practical implicationsExpanding physical access to institutional credit alone may not necessarily spur increased uptake of credit and instant investment by farm households. For a majority of them to take advantage of available credit and improved technology, interventions should also aim at minimizing downside risks.Originality/valueThis paper incorporates the role of downside risk in influencing farmer's decisions to uptake credits and subsequently his/her adoption behaviors.

Theoretical framework and methods for the analysis of the adoption-diffusion of innovations in agriculture: a bibliometric review,"The adoption and diffusion of innovations are essential for both the development of production processes and the improvement of agricultural environmental sustainability, at any stage of the value chain. In recent years, social scientists have studied the diffusion and adoption of agricultural innovations from different approaches, such as innovation diffusion theory, behavioral models, econometric models, social capital and social network analysis, among others. In this study we analyze the scientific literature through a bibliometric analysis based on co-citation networks, to explore the theoretical pillars and bibliographic coupling, with which we explore the current methodological research trends of the last 50 years. The conclusions drawn from this analysis are that in recent years agricultural researchers on adoption and diffusion have designed multivariate methods that combine diverse study approaches.

"The Effect of Social Network on Controlled-Release Fertilizer Use: Evidence from Rice Large-Scale Farmers in Jiangsu Province, China","The reduction and efficiency of fertilizer use has been a recent focus of governments and scholars. As a new agricultural technology, controlled-release fertilizer can not only increase yield and save labor, but also improve efficiency and reduce the use of fertilizer, thus promoting sustainable agricultural development. Drawing on a sample of 231 farmers of Jiangsu Province, China, this paper applies a probit model to assess the adoption behavior of controlled-release fertilizer by large-scale households in terms of three dimensions of social network, i.e., communication intensity, trust level, and network size, specifically exploring how science popularization influences their adoption intention, and comparing the heterogeneity of impact that social network has on the adoption intention of farmers when the information is obtained adequately or not. The empirical results demonstrate that: (1) At the early stage of technology diffusion, the size of social network has a positive effect on farmers’ cognition of controlled-release fertilizer, and the communication intensity with neighboring farmers has a positive effect on the adoption behavior of controlled-release fertilizer; (2) Farmers’ adoption intention of controlled-release fertilizer is significantly influenced by their original knowledge of new technology and science popularization; (3) When the information is sufficient, the social network of large-scale households has no significant effect on their willingness to adopt. Therefore, in promoting controlled-release fertilizer, the government should highlight the synergistic effect of farmers’ cognition and science popularization activities, fully consider the characteristics of farmers’ social network, facilitate the infrastructure of rural informatization, and regulate the agricultural promotion networks so that farmers can obtain sufficient and effective information.",2023.0,Sustainability,Sustainability,"Ruoxi Ma, Shangguang Yang",10.3390/su15042982,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c7f1fadf63a1961bba62ee1b040babce3a768161,54.0,5.0,0.0,,"[{'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Sociology', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/4/2982/pdf?version=1675759381,,2023-02-07
"Suburban agriculture, immigrant farmers, and access to agricultural services and resources","While agricultural services are shrinking, the num­ber of nontraditional farms run by immigrant farm­ers is rising in U.S. suburban regions. This study attempts to understand Chinese immigrant farmers’ experience accessing agricultural services and resources in the New York metropolitan area and explores the need for changes in agricultural ser­vices to meet changing demand. Thirteen Chinese immigrant farmers in the region were recruited to participate in a semi-structured interview to under­stand their shared experiences of accessing agricul­tural services and resources. The study identified diverse ways of accessing agricultural services and resources in four critical areas of farming opera­tions: agricultural technology, financial services, farm labor, and farming machinery; and also revealed the existence of “liability of newness” among those new immigrant farmers in operating farms. Most participants felt that they were iso­lated, with limited access to available services as new immigrant farmers, which constitutes the lia­bilities to their success in farming. Language barri­ers, cultural differences, distrust, and isolation were the main obstacles to access adequate services and resources. As farms and farmers are becoming more diverse in U.S. suburban regions, the provi­sion of agricultural services needs to adapt accord­ingly to meet the growing needs of groups of farm­ers with varying farming experiences and demographic backgrounds and help them to over­come the liabilities as new immigrant farmers. This study contributes to understanding the farming experiences of minority farm groups, which help develop more inclusive agricultural services.",2023.0,"Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development","Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development","Linfu Xie, Z.

Farmers’ social networks and regional spillover effects in agricultural climate change mitigation,"Climate change poses a severe threat to global agricultural production and rural livelihoods, and since agriculture itself is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it can also play an important role in climate change mitigation. This article investigates how farmers’ social networks influence the adoption of on-farm mitigation strategies. More precisely, we use a network autocorrelation model to explore the relationship between a farmer’s own mitigation behavior and the mitigation behavior and knowledge of his fellow farmers. The analysis is based on a regional case study in Switzerland and uses data obtained from personal network interviews combined with survey and census data of 50 farmers. Half of them are members of a local collective action initiative for agricultural climate change mitigation, while the others do not participate in the initiative. We find that, on average, farmers with a larger network adopt more mitigation measures, and furthermore, mitigation adoption is linked with the level of knowledge within farmers’ networks. Indeed, the likelihood that non-members will adopt mitigation measures increases if they are closely associated with members of the collective action, suggesting a local spillover effect. It follows that strengthening knowledge exchange among farmers and supporting local farmers’ initiatives can potentially contribute to the diffusion of agricultural climate change mitigation practices.",2023.0,Climatic Change,Climatic Change,"Cordelia Kreft, Mario Angst, R.

Do Not Be Anticlimactic: Farmers’ Behavior in the Sustainable Application of Green Agricultural Technology—A Perceived Value and Government Support Perspective,"The production mode of “high input, high yield and high waste” in the agricultural system poses a serious threat to the environment and the quality of agricultural products. Accelerating the adoption of green agricultural technology (GAT) by farmers is an emergency measure. However, according to microsurvey data, many farmers give up GAT within a year after adopting it. The implementation of this measure has been anticlimactic. Based on a survey of 1138 kiwi growers in Shaanxi Province, China, this paper builds a theoretical model and conducts empirical exercises to gain insight into the effects of perceived value, government support and their interaction with kiwi growers’ sustainable application of GAT. We find that perceived value and government support have a significant impact on the sustainable application of GAT. Government support plays a moderating role in the influence of perceived value on the sustainable application of GAT. Furthermore, in order to overcome the potential endogeneity problem caused by the two-way causal relationship between subjective variables, “owning a smartphone” was selected as the instrumental variable. The 2SLS model was used for endogeneity analysis, and the OLS model was used for the robustness test.

"Analysis of Factors Influencing the Adoption Behavior of Agricultural Productive Services Based on Logistic—ISM Model: A Case Study of Rice Farmers in Jiangxi Province, China","Agricultural productive services can increase grain output and farmers’ incomes, promote agricultural production efficiency and break the constraints of agricultural environmental resources. In practice, China’s agricultural productive services are developing, and the use of agricultural machinery in rice planting is not sufficient. The employment rate of machinery in farming and harvesting is high, but the employment rate of machinery in seedling raising, planting, fertilization, and pesticide spraying is very low. This paper takes rice farmers in Jiangxi Province of China as the research object, uses 647 survey data of farmers in nine counties of Jiangxi Province, constructs a logistic-ISM model, first identifies the influencing factors of rice farmers’ adoption of agricultural productive services, and then analyzes the hierarchical structure of each influencing factor. The results indicate that: (1) among the seven significant influencing factors of rice farmers’ adoption of agricultural productive services, agricultural income rate and rice planting area are the deep-rooted factors; (2) the social identity of the household head, the risk preference of the household head and the understanding degree of the social service subsidy of agricultural machinery are intermediate level factors; and (3) the age of the household head and the number of agricultural laborers in the family are the direct factors. Based on the significance analysis of the influencing factors of rice farmers’ adoption of agricultural productive services, this paper puts forward policy suggestions to strengthen policy publicity, enhance the level of farmer policy cognition; encourage the transfer of labor force and reasonable allocation of family agricultural labor force; encourage land transfer and expand the scale operation of rice; we should guide farmers reasonably and give full play to their professional advantages.",2023.0,Agriculture,Agriculture,"J.

Categorisation of Biogas Plant Operators in Germany with Regards to Their Intention to Use Straw Pellets as Innovative and Sustainable Substrate Alternative,"The cultivation of renewable raw materials on arable land is challenged by the ongoing fuel-versus-food debate resulting from increases in maize cultivation, shorter crop rotations and land competition. Accordingly, the current legal framework for biogas production in Germany focuses on limiting cultivation of traditional biogas substrates, such as silage maize, and promoting the use of various alternatives, such as waste materials and by-products. One new sustainable substrate alternative is the use of cereal straw compacted to pellets. Although straw pellets generally have good fermentation properties, they are still rarely used in German biogas production. Since earlier research on agricultural production practices in general has shown that farmers can be divided into groups regarding their acceptance behaviour and the speed to successfully adopt innovative practices and technologies on their farm, this study addresses the research question: How can biogas plant operators in Germany be categorised with regards to their intention to use straw pellets as innovative and sustainable substrate alternatives? In order to answer this question an exploratory factor analysis and subsequent hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted with survey data obtained from German biogas plant operators (n = 309) in early 2021. Based on variables indicating the intention to use and use behaviour regarding straw pellets in biogas plants, four clusters are identified. Plant operator’s innovativeness, perceived risk and the influence of social environment show differences between the clusters. Additionally, the characteristics of the innovation “straw pellets”, such as economic performance and sustainability, were assessed differently by the four clusters of German biogas plant operators. While the clusters do not show significant differences in the socio-demographic characteristics, they do so in the farm characteristics (farm activities besides biogas production, size of the plant, the proportion of slurry/dung and silage maize). According to the results two of the four clusters have a higher acceptance of straw pellets, which also means that they are earlier in considering the actual use. The initiation of regional working groups, information campaigns and financial incentives can support plant operators, especially in the two clusters of potential early adopters, in accepting straw pellets. This should ultimately result in a faster and wider use of straw pellets as substrates in the whole biogas sector.",2022.0,Energies,Energies,"Sören Mohrmann, V.

"Coleopteran Diversity at the three selected areas in Dhaka City, Bangladesh","The diversity of coleopteran species was studied at three different selected areas in Dhaka city from December 2016 to November 2017. A total of 11,397 individuals of 56 coleopteran species belonging to 50 genera, including 15 families, were recorded in the study areas during the study period. Of them, 47 species (4916 individuals) of 13 families were found at the Ramna Park, 48 species (2441 individuals) of 15 families at the National Botanical Garden, and 42 species (4040 individuals) of 11 families at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) campus. A total of 30 species, 25 genera, and 11 families were common in these three study areas. At the Ramna Park, the highest species richness included the family Chrysomelidae (34.04%), and the lowest was under the six families including Staphylinidae, Bostrichidae, Nitidulidae, Geotrupidae, Erotylidae, and Scarabaeidae (2.13%). At the National Botanical Garden, the maximum number of species was recorded under the family Chrysomelidae (6.24%), and the lowest was under seven families including Staphylinidae, Bostrichidae, Nitidulidae, Geotrupidae, Erotylidae, Elateridae, and Dermestidae (2.08%). The maximum number of coleopteran species was identified under the family Chrysomelidae (35.71%), and the lowest was under six families including Staphylinidae, Cerambycidae, Nitidulidae, Geotrupidae, Elateridae, and Dermestidae (2.38%) at the AERE campus. The Shanon’s Diversity Index (H′) and Simpson’s Index (λ) indicate high coleopteran diversity at the Ramna Park (H′=3.41, λ=0.05), the AERE Campus (H′=3.07, λ=0.06), and the National Botanical Garden (H′=2.93, λ=0.08). The high species evenness in the Ramna Park (J’= 0.89) and the AERE campus (J’= 0.82) indicates that the species were evenly distributed, whereas at the National Botanical Garden (J’= 0.76) they were comparatively less evenly distributed. The calculated Sorenson’s Coefficient (CC) is 0.66, indicating that these three communities were fairly similar or overlapped. The Community Dominances were 21.03%, 32.16% and 18.66% for the Ramna Park, National Botanical Garden, and AERE campus, respectively.

Socio-Economic Constraints of Adopting New Cowpea Varieties in Three Agro-Ecological Zones in the Senegalese Peanut Basin,"Socio-economic constraints like gender, education, age, and income significantly affect the adoption of improved agricultural technologies. The objective of this study was to determine socio-economic factors that affect the adoption of improved cowpea varieties in the Senegalese peanut basin. The study was conducted in three (Bambey, Kebemer, and Kaffrine) of six regions of the peanut basin based on regional importance of cowpea production and rainfall gradient. In each study region, ten villages were selected, and random sampling was used to select eight heads of agricultural households within each village. The questionnaires were administered to 240 randomly selected farmers across the three study regions, 7 communes, and 30 villages. Results showed most heads of households were middle-aged (52–54 years old), married (95–100%), illiterate (84%), and men (95–100%). Households were mostly agriculture dependent (87%), low literacy rates (26% least primary school), and large family sizes (average of 15 members). The median cowpea yields across the study area varied from 35–100 kg ha−1, well below the ~300–400 kg ha−1 average yields reported for Senegal and Sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of farmers (67%) in the study regions did not use improved varieties, and the main reasons were low seed availability (78.8%) and limited access to technical knowledge and information (76.3%), but only 5.8% indicated seed price as a barrier to improved variety adoption. Major uses of cowpea in the study area were for marketing, livestock feed, and human consumption. In Kaffrine, fodder production was the major (85%) criterion for cowpea variety selection, whereas in the north (Bambey and Kebemer), taste, maturity date, and grain yield were major selection criteria. Factors that had positive effect on the likelihood of using improved cowpea varieties include; access to extension services, membership in farmers’ organization, cowpea being the main crop of production, organic farming, market, and livestock-oriented production systems, access to farmland and credit, dependence on agriculture as the main source of household income, and education of head of household. We conclude that there is a critical need for training, access to improved seeds, awareness, and financial support to producers to increase the adoption of new improved cowpea varieties, yields, profitability, and nutritional security among smallholder farmers in the Senegalese peanut basin.",2022.0,Sustainability,Sustainability,"A.

Farmers' preferences for sustainable intensification attributes in sorghum-based cropping systems: evidence from Mali,"Abstract Sorghum plays a crucial role in the rural economy and nutrition of rural households in Mali. Yet the productivity of this crop is constrained by limited adoption of agricultural intensification technologies, which could be partly because technology development does not properly consider farmers' preferences. This study with smallholder farmers in southern Mali aimed to assess farmers' preferences for different attributes of sorghum technologies through the lens of sustainable intensification. The study used a discrete choice experiment, a method which involves asking individuals to state their preference over hypothetical alternative scenarios, goods or services. We considered six attributes corresponding to different domains of sustainable intensification: grain yield, risk of yield loss, soil fertility, nutrition, labor requirement and fodder yield. We analyzed the data using the mixed logit model, while considering the multinomial logit model as a robustness check. The findings revealed that smallholder farmers are strongly interested in transitioning from their existing sorghum-based cropping systems to those that closely align with these domains of sustainable intensification. However, there were diverse preferences among all the smallholder farmers studied, and between distinct sub-groups of smallholder farmers characterized by their social networks and agroecological zones, which yield relevant policy implications. Overall, these results support the growing research and development prioritization and policy interests toward scaling sustainable intensification among farmers, with a particular focus on human nutrition.",2022.0,Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems,Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems,"F.

Uncovering the Deviation of Farmers’ Green Manure Planting Willingness and Behavior,"Planting green manure is an effective way to improve the agricultural environment and the quality of cultivated land in China. However, deviation from green manure planting willingness and behavior (DWB) becomes a serious obstacle to the promotion of green manure planting technology. For economic farmers, whether to plant green manure is a rational choice made after weighing up family endowments. In addition, ecological cognition plays a moderating role in the “willingness-behavior” transformation process of farmers’ green manure planting on the basis of family endowments. We selected four counties in which to conduct a questionnaire survey in Gansu and carried out interviews with 375 farmers. Based on the survey data, our study identified determinants that influence farmers’ DWB and examined the moderating effect of ecological cognition. In our paper, results show that the probability of farmers’ DWB is 41.87%. Farmers’ DWB is not only negatively affected by social network information and ecological compensation (eco-compensation) and positively influenced by the scale of cultivated land, but also restricted by human capital endowment characteristics such as age and education. In addition, ecological cognition played a significant moderating effect on farmers’ DWB. Farmers with high ecological cognition were more aware and capable of promoting green manure planting intentions into practice. Furthermore, different groups of farmers had different characteristics of DWB. The findings are useful and helpful in better understand the influencing factors of farmers’ DWB for policy makers and managers and can provide some effective support for policies designed to encourage farmers to adopt more sustainable green manure.",2022.0,Sustainability,Sustainability,"Jing Ren, Fuduo Li, Changbin Yin, Jiudong Zhang",10.3390/su142114315,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63c943e06f5e57c696918923191d529beefe0524,45.0,6.0,0.0,,"[{'category': 'Environmental Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/21/14315/pdf?version=1667379762,['Review'],2022-11-02

Social networking and risk attitudes nexus: implication for technology adoption among smallholder cassava farmers in Ghana,"Theoretically, social climate and social networking which may affect attitudes, motivations, and readiness towards quality improvement and rewards, influence the adoption decision process by possibly modifying the risk behaviour/attitudes of individuals. Thus for effective promotion of agricultural technologies among farmers in Africa, it is necessary to understand the social context within which risk attitudes are formed and social participation decisions are made. The study, therefore, employed the recursive bivariate endogenous switching probit model to examine how risk attitudes of farmers are shaped through social interactions in the information and communication networks of farmers to influence their technology adoption decisions. Here, the empirical application was done with the contextual case of agriculture intensification technologies in the Root and Tuber Improvement and Marketing Programme (RTIMP) introduced to smallholder cassava farmers in Ghana. This paper makes a contribution to recent advances in the empirical analysis of impact where anticipated problems posed by unobserved confounders are accounted for. This was possible since the approach used allows for the estimation of the treatment effect of endogenous risk attitude variable of interest on farmers’ adoption decisions. The study found that the effectiveness and usefulness of social interactions as well as a high degree of trust by cassava farmers in their social networks have higher tendencies to lower the degree of risk aversion behaviour of the farmers to significantly influence RTIMP Technologies adoption decisions positively. The ATE estimate confirms that there has been a significant increase of 38% probability in the likelihood of adopting agricultural intensification technologies in the RTIMP attributable to the non-risk aversion attitudes of cassava farmers. The cassava farmers’ risk attitudes were found to be significantly influenced by the effectiveness and usefulness of social interactions, and a high degree of trust as well as age, frequency of extension services, access to credit, and revenue. By implication, attempts to introduce innovations to improve agricultural commodities value chains that target farmers must pay particular attention to the information and communication network to ensure the effectiveness and usefulness of information dissemination to farmers in an honest manner, so as to build trust; which will go a long way to reduce doubts and uncertainties (function of risk aversion). This will help achieve higher innovation adoption impacts thereby resulting in attaining the overall deliverable objectives of agricultural innovations.",2022.0,Agriculture & Food Security,Agriculture & Food Security,"S.

Learning about Our Vices from Devices: A Model of Individual Learning with an Application to Consumer Food Waste,"The proliferation of personal, household and workplace sensors and devices has created individual environments rich with purposeful and incidental feedback capable of altering behavior. We formulate an empirical learning model suitable for understanding individual behavioral responses in such environments. We estimate this model using data collected about the joint personal decisions of food selection, intake, and waste during a study in which users photographed their meal selections and plate waste over the course of a week with a cell phone. Despite neutral recruitment language and no expectation that participants would alter food intake in response to the assessment procedures, we found a substantial learning-by-doing effect in plate waste reduction as those who document greater plate waste in their captured photographs waste less on subsequent days. Further we identified that participants reduced plate waste by learning to eat more rather than by learning to reduce the amount of food selected.",2022.0,Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics,Journal of agricultural and resource economics,"Danyi Qi, B.

Social interaction and geographic diffusion of iron‐biofortified beans in Rwanda,"This study analyzes smallholder farmers’ decisions to adopt beans with higher levels of dietary iron developed through a conventional breeding technique called biofortification. We approach this study by applying spatial econometric techniques to estimate neighborhood influence and to determine the factors driv-ing the adoption of iron-biofortified beans (IBB). We employ a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of bean producing households from 2015 bean growing season B in Rwanda, and present results for growers of both bush and climbing varieties of beans. The results show geographic diffusion of iron bean planting material occurs among neighboring farmers that exhibit interdependent decision-making patterns, as well as similar characteristics relative to the group. Some policy implications can be drawn from the results. First, a differentiated geographical targeting strategy for bush and climbing bean varieties as a function of farmer and farm characteristics should increase iron bean adoption rates. Second, strengthening partnerships with delivery agents and extensionists should stimulate the adoption of IBB varieties. And finally, technology-promotion programs that consider progressive farmers and strengthen social interactions and group activities among peer networks should increase the spread of information and diffusion of IBB.",2022.0,Agricultural Economics,Agricultural Economics,"J.

Stimulating Innovations for Sustainable Agricultural Practices among Smallholder Farmers: Persistence of Intervention Matters,"Abstract As part of the dissemination of sustainable intensification (SI) of agricultural practices in northern Ghana, farmers were conditionally induced with inputs to adopt the SI practices. We study the effects of the conditional inducement on maize yield and net income of farmers under a quasi-randomised phase-out design. We examine the effects of the inducement by comparing continuous induced farmers with past induced and non-induced farmers. Our results indicate that the conditional inducement led to an increase in the maize yield and the net income of continuously induced farmers, on average. Estimates also suggest that the continuously induced farmers would have had their maize yields and net incomes decreased by about 64 per cent and 54 per cent, respectively if the inducement had been discontinued. Distributional analysis reveals that the inducement effects are heterogeneous and that past inducement impacted more on the maize yield and the net income of farmers at the lower quantiles. We conclude that appropriate conditional inducement can stimulate farmers’ adoption. Besides, the duration of intervention matters and must not be overlooked in interventions that necessitate gaining experience and learning.",2022.0,Journal of Development Studies,The Journal of Development Studies,"Shaibu Mellon Bedi, Lukas Kornher, Joachim von Braun, B.

"Social Network, Production Purpose, and Biological Pesticide Application Behavior of Rice Farmers","The extension and diffusion of the green production mode in rural areas forms the micro basis for improve the ecological environment. While government has issued a series of policies to promote the green production mode, the effect depends on farmers’ behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the causes and mechanisms underlying the influence of farmers’ behavior differences with regard to biopesticide application. Based on 1202 sampled rice farmers in China, this paper analyzes the impact of social network on their biological pesticide application behavior. Furthermore, the internal transmission mechanism of social network on biological pesticide application behavior of “ration-making” farmers (whose main purpose is to meet the demand for rations) and “profit-making” famers (whose main goal is to maximize their profit) is studied according to different production purposes. The results show that: 1) Social network has a significant positive role in promoting rice farmers’ biological pesticide application behavior. 2) Social network encourages rice farmers to apply biological pesticides by influencing both their behavioral attitude and behavioral efficacy toward green production. 3) The intermediary effect of behavioral efficacy exceeds that of behavioral attitude. 4) Compared with “profit-making” farmers, the biological pesticides application of “ration-making” farmers is stronger affected by their social network. Operation mode, operation scale, and educational level positively affect the pesticide application behavior of “profit-making” farmers, while age imposes a significantly negative influence. Biopesticide application of “ration-making” farmers is negatively affected by age and education level and positively affected by the mode of operation. 5) The behavioral attitude and behavioral efficacy of green production exert significant mediating effects on both types of farmers. Moreover, both intermediary variables exert stronger impacts on “profit-making” farmers. To a certain extent, this study expands the theoretical explanation of the “rational man” in neoclassical economics, and provides reliable evidence, both theoretical and empirical, for effective measures to stimulate green production in rice farmers.",2022.0,Frontiers in Environmental Science,,"Zhaoliang Li, Mande Zhu, Q.

Heterogenous Factors of Adoption of Agricultural Technologies in West and East Africa Countries: A Review,"This review brings to light, extensive body of research on the evolvement of agricultural technology in Sub-Saharan Africa with focus on adoption studies in West and East Africa countries. The review highlights historical green revolution events and the heterogeneity in the determinants of the adoption of agricultural technology. Three key popular indicators in adoption studies were reviewed for their heterogeneity; this includes land, extension & social institutions, and gender in light of comparison of studies in West and East Africa. The review shows that there is so much to be gained from enhancing the understanding of the heterogeneity that exists in key popular indicators in adoption studies considering the importance of adoption of agricultural technology in reducing poverty and food insecurity and the evolving impact of climate change and other human attributes that has defined the modification of various agricultural technology. Also, the review highlights the need to tailor extension and social learning toward existing heterogeneity to aid in promoting the adoption of agricultural technology. An important highlight includes the need to be wary of the downsides of the earlier green revolution while driving the efforts of new green revolution in West and East Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa in general.",2022.0,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,,Zainab Oyetunde-Usman,10.3389/fsufs.2022.761498,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/72319cea72814dac8167f87a8aa2183bdedd5a77,112.0,11.0,0.0,,"[{'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2022.761498/pdf,['Review'],2022-03-16

Digitalization and Tax Compliance Spillovers: Evidence from a VAT e-Invoicing Reform in Peru,": Our study uses administrative data on firm-to-firm transactions and quasi- experimental variation in the rollout of electronic invoicing reforms in Peru to study the diffusion of e-invoicing through firm networks and its effect on tax compliance. We find that voluntary e-invoicing adoption is higher amongst firms with partners who are mandated to adopt e-invoicing, implying positive technology adoption spillovers. Spillovers are stronger from downstream partners and from export-oriented firms. Firms are less likely to continue transacting with a partner who has been mandated into e-invoicing, with the effect only partially reversed if both firms adopt e-invoicing, suggesting that network segmentation may occur. Smaller firms who transact with partners mandated into e-invoicing report 11 percent more sales and pay 17 more VAT in the year that their partner is mandated to adopt e-invoicing, suggesting positive spillovers in tax compliance behavior for this subset of firms.",2022.0,IMF Working Papers,IMF Working Papers,"M.

Mobile money networks with tax-incentives,"Mobile money (MM) is the most promising tool to enable more individuals living in rural and marginalized communities into the banking sector. Although private companies in some developing countries have transitioned most of its users over to MM, it remains unclear if government-initiated programs would be as successful. By accessing a comprehensive data set of the first MM project to be initiated by a government, we tracked the behavior of users within the MM network. Temporal analysis of network representations of MM transactions shows how agents behave over time and how they react when given tax-incentives for the use of non-cash transactions. Tax-incentives had immediate positive effects on the economic activity of continuing users (number of transactions, mean and total value of transactions) and a marginal effect on their interconnectedness (number of partners and clustering). However, the tax-incentive distorted economic behavior and had a modest effect on the adoption and diffusion of MM over time at a high price tag. Implementation of these new technologies requires consideration of the peculiarity of the different actors and the expansion of the network over time, as well as the specific characteristics of each economy. These findings offer important lessons that would be valuable to other governments and policymakers considering MM.",2022.0,Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,"I.

High-yielding seeds in unyielding environments: Examining the learning process of maize and bean producers in eastern and midwestern Uganda,"This paper examines the learning process by which farmers come to a decision to use newly introduced seeds which were promoted through demonstration plots in midwestern and eastern regions of Uganda. Framed as social and material interactions, we investigated the learning process of the demonstration plots using data from focus group discussions, interviews and a survey amongst 983 individuals. The results reveal several constraints that impede learning, resulting in an overall low awareness and adoption of the introduced seeds. Some of the most prominent constraints resulted from the selection of location and demonstration plot host, the distance of agro-dealers, at district headquarters, limited interactions amongst farmers and irregular involvement of farmers in the demonstrations. Moreover, the prominent role of agro-dealers at field days suggests that informing farmers about where to buy seeds was considered more important than explaining farmers how to grow these seeds profitably. This commercial focus of field days and demonstrations plots had negative consequences for the social learning. This paper contributes to the learning and adoption literature by showing that interactions amongst actors can improve or reduce the balance between didactic, social and environmental learning.",2021.0,Outlook on Agriculture,Outlook on Agriculture,"Claris Riungu, H.

Land and heterogenous constraints nexus income diversification strategies in Ethiopia: systematic review,"Background Agriculture is a key to Africa’s future. With alarming population growth, the quest for land increases not only for farming, but also for housing, and the building of industries. Likewise, Ethiopian highlands, cultivated landholding sizes are very small and the land-to-man ratio is declining over time. This exposes the young rural population to facing severe land constraints, poverty, and food insecurity. In addition, constraints facing rural households are inevitably varied and diverse. Hence, this paper examines an in-depth and systematic review of how the rural economy responds to the existing land constraints and what specifically drives them for income diversification outlooks; accumulative or survival strategies in the spatial and temporal dimensions. Method We have used a systematic review with concept definitions and a qualitative approach that relies on the analysis of current literature and deductive logical reasoning to generate a comprehensive scientific understanding of a topic that can capitalize information for future research and policies. Different inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and filtered pertinent articles to this study in countrywide verdicts. Result The burgeoning literature underscores farm sizes are strongly and positively correlated with net farm income and overall livelihood options, and land constraint leads to rural poverty. One of the pressing issues in rural, as well as urban areas, is that millions of small-scale farmers are becoming landless, and forced as daily laborers for other income sources or joining the already massively overloaded urban and peri-urban low-productivity services sector. In addition, skill, capital (financial and physical), and multiple constraints coupled with the small land sizes including high unemployment, social tension, migration and crowding out the nearest towns. Further, findings pointed out that rural market failures—particularly in the areas of land and finance—force poorer subpopulations to choose strategies with demonstrably lower returns, while wealthier ones are engaging in higher returns with lower marginal and entry costs of participation. Hence, push-and-pull factors of off-farm and non-farm engagements are the survival strategies and persuade the social welfare of the poor. Conclusion With heterogenous constraints, diversification patterns reflect people's voluntary asset exchanges and asset allocation across diverse activities to attain the best possible balance of projected returns and risk exposure given the restrictions they confront due to missing or incomplete markets for land, credit, or labor. Particular emphasis for the vibrant income diversification strategies should be set in and policymakers must stimulate buoyant rural economies, with robust non-farm and off-farm income and innovative farming practices. Hence, the poor must gain access to the growing market niches and basic infrastructure development. Smooth and unconstrained labor markets provide one important bridge linking the rural poor to growing non-farm opportunities.",2021.0,Agriculture & Food Security,Agriculture & Food Security,Esubalew Tadele,10.1186/s40066-021-00338-1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/474825b3487b1742b1d3f00fca8f44e390ac3fa4,82.0,10.0,0.0,,"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Geography', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://agricultureandfoodsecurity.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40066-021-00338-1,['Review'],2021-09-28

Social Learning and Policy Adoption: Evidence from an Education Reform in Brazil,"Abstract We investigate the role of social learning among local government officials in fostering the diffusion of an education programme presented with a reasonable degree of technological and political uncertainty about its outcomes, the schooling decentralisation reform in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. We consider different natures of the exchange of information on the newly adopted tasks, and assess which aspects of the returns to programme participation were most valued by officials in their learning process. Specifically, we attempt to determine the extent to which adherence to the reform resulted from electoral motivations rather than from concerns regarding the quality of education. We present evidence that social learning constitutes a key factor to policy implementation, and we find that mayors that could run for re-election became more likely to support the programme upon receiving good news about its electoral returns. By contrast, information on experiences that were successful in improving the quality of education appears to have been valued and effectively put to use only by term-limited officials or when conveyed by copartisan neighbours.",2021.0,Journal of Development Studies,The Journal of Development Studies,"T.

How Does Perceived Value Affect Kiwi Growers' Sustainable Application of Green Agricultural Technology in China? - Moderating Effect Analysis Based on Government Support,"
 Unsafe use of pesticides and fertilizers is a concern in rural areas of China, resulting in serious threats to environment and the quality of agricultural products. Many works have studied the factors influencing the adoption of green agricultural technology by farmers. However, few studies have explored the factors that lead to a farmer’s sustainable use of green agricultural technology. Based on a survey of 1,138 kiwi growers in Shaanxi province of China, this paper builds a theoretical model to look at this issue and conducts a series of empirical exercises to gain insight into the effects of perceived value, government support and their interaction on kiwi growers' sustainable application of green agricultural technology. We find that (1) Perceived monetary and non-monetary benefits positively affect the sustainable application of green agricultural technology by farmers while perceived monetary and non-monetary risks affect it negatively. In addition, such influence would be enhanced with an increase in the intensity of perceived value and vary with the type of green agricultural technology. (2) Both agricultural extension service and ecological subsidy, as two main forms of government support, have a positive and significant effect on the sustainable application of green agricultural technology. (3) There is also a role for the interaction effects between the influence of perceived value and government support on the sustainable application of green agricultural technology. Therefore, it has been proposed in this paper that the government should expand relevant publicity, education, training, and guidance, offer compensatory incentives for producers, and adopt guiding methods corresponding to different green agricultural technology, so as to promote the sustainable application of green production modes by farmers.",2021.0,,,"W.

Evolution of Learning in Technology Adoption: The case of the U.S. Soybean Seed Industry,"This paper examines how the evolution of learning affects technology adoption. We use a sequential adoption model that accounts for differences between forward-looking adopters, who consider future impacts of their learning, and myopic adopters, who only consider past learning. We apply the analysis to three panels of U.S. soybean farmers representing different stages of the genetically modified (GM) seed technology diffusion path. We show that uncertainty is considerably reduced over time due to increased learning efficiency. Our results indicate that a forward-looking model fits the early adopters and early majority stages better, while both models perform equally well in the laggard stage.

"Bounded Rationality, Social Capital and Technology Adoption in Family Farming: Evidence from Cocoa-Tree Crops in Ivory Coast","In this paper, we allege that the hypothesis in favor of bounded rationality is a plausible explanation when it comes to better understanding the sluggish pace of adoption of best available tree crop farming techniques in poor small-scale rural communities. Our research builds on data collection and analysis of cocoa farming in Ivory Coast. Firstly, we find that the cognitive scarcity under which smallholder farmers make their decisions, in particular, satisficing behavior and fast and frugal heuristics, outweigh the scarcity of financial and human resources. Secondly, we show that the structure of the environment measured through various dimensions of social capital influences human rationality and decision-making. On the one hand, the greater smallholder farmers’ civic capital (solidarity, reciprocity, trustworthiness, cooperation), the more likely they are to modify their farming practices (p < 0.05) and, more specifically, to exchange information, learn, and eventually revise these practices. On the other hand, the greater the number of organizations the farmers participate in, the greater the probability of modifying their practices (p < 0.01).

Towards an Understanding of the Behavioral Intentions and Actual Use of Smart Products among German Farmers,"Innovative technologies in the context of smart farming are expected to play a significant role in the adaptation of the agricultural sector to climate change and sustainable agriculture. However, the adoption of smart farming solutions, in this case so-called smart products, depends indispensably on the acceptance of farmers. For this reason, it is important to develop an understanding of what determinants are decisive for farmers in the adoption of these technologies. In order to address this research gap, farmers in Germany were surveyed via a large-scale online survey in 2020 (n = 523). Based on an extended version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, a Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis was performed. The results indicate that hedonic motivation significantly influences farmers’ behavioral intention to use smart products. In addition, behavioral intention is affected by social determinants and the personal performance expectations of smart products. Trust, as well as facilitating conditions, also has an impact on behavioral intention. Furthermore, facilitating conditions are an important determinant of the actual use behavior. In addition, use behavior is influenced by behavioral intention. It was further found that technology readiness plays a significant role in the adoption of smart products. Moderating effects of age, work experience, and farm size were identified that influence farmers’ willingness to use smart products. The study holds important managerial implications for technology companies in the field of smart farming and can help develop approaches for tailored technical solutions that meet farmers’ needs.",2021.0,Sustainability,Sustainability,"Sirkka Schukat, H.

Smart Products in Livestock Farming—An Empirical Study on the Attitudes of German Farmers,"Simple Summary In the last few years, the fourth industrial revolution has found its way into agriculture. Under the heading of smart farming, various so-called smart products are offered that can positively influence the daily work of farmers as well as animal welfare. These smart products can record data from the farming operation, extract essential information, and in some cases even make decisions autonomously. Particularly in Germany, where social criticism of intensive livestock farming has been raised, such smart products could make a significant contribution to improving animal welfare. However, a key prerequisite is the acceptance of the users, who are typically the livestock farmers themselves. There is so far hardly any knowledge about farmers’ attitudes towards smart products in livestock farming. In this study, the attitudes of German livestock farmers towards smart products are evaluated by categorizing them into groups by a factor analysis and a cluster analysis. Based on the analysis of an online questionnaire, in which German livestock farmers (n = 422) participated, four clusters could be derived. The main distinguishing characteristics of the clusters are the influence of the social environment, the expected effort for implementation, the general trust in smart products, and the technology readiness of the farms. As a result, this study provides valuable insights, for technology providers of smart products for livestock farming, as well as for policymakers. Abstract In recent years, the fourth industrial revolution has found its way into agriculture. Under the term smart farming, various so-called smart products are offered that may positively influence both the daily work of farmers and animal welfare. These smart products can collect data from the farm, extract important information, and in some cases even make decisions independently. Particularly in Germany, where intensive livestock farming is criticized by society, such smart products could make a significant contribution to improving animal welfare. However, an important prerequisite is the acceptance of the users, who are usually the livestock farmers themselves. So far, there is little knowledge about farmers’ attitudes towards smart products in livestock production. In this study, a factor analysis and a cluster analysis are conducted to evaluate the attitudes of German livestock farmers towards smart products. Based on the analysis of an online questionnaire in which German livestock farmers (n = 422) participated, four clusters could be derived. The main distinguishing characteristics of the clusters are the influence of the social environment, the expected effort for implementation, the general trust in smart products, and the technology readiness of the farms.

Firm-Level Technology Adoption in Vietnam,"This paper describes the results of a new firm survey to measure technology use and adoption implemented prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. It analyzes the use and adoption of technology among Vietnamese firms and identifies some of the key barriers to adoption and diffusion. The analysis offers new and important stylized facts on firm-level use of technologies. First, although access to the internet is almost universal in Vietnam, firms had low digital readiness to face the COVID-19 pandemic; and the share of establishments with their own website, social media, and cloud computing is still small. Second, the use of Industry 4.0 technologies is incipient. Third, the technology gap with the use of frontier technologies in some general business functions, such as quality control, production planning, sales, and sourcing and procurement, is large. Fourth, the manufacturing sector faces the largest technological gap, larger than services and agricultural firms. The analysis of the main barriers and drivers to technology adoption and use shows the importance of good management quality for technology adoption, and that there is a technology premium associated with exporting activities. Finally, the analysis also shows that firms are largely unaware of the available public policy support for technology upgrading.",2021.0,,Research Papers in Economics,"X. Cirera, D.

Using an Artificial Neural Networks Experiment to Assess the Links among Financial Development and Growth in Agriculture,"Financial development, productivity, and growth are interconnected, but the direction of causality remains unclear. The relevance of these linkages is likely different for developing and developed economies, yet comparative cross-country studies are scant. The paper analyses the relationship among credit access, output and productivity in the agricultural sector for a large set of countries, over the period 2000–2012, using an Artificial Neural Networks approach. Empirical findings show that these three variables influence each other reciprocally, although marked differences exist among groups of countries. The role of credit access is more prominent for the OECD countries and less important for countries with a lower level of economic de-elopement. Our analysis allows us to highlight the specific effects of credit in stimulating the development of the agricultural sector: in developing countries, credit access significantly affects production, whereas in developed countries, it also has an impact on productivity.",2021.0,Sustainability,Sustainability,"Cosimo Magazzino, M.

Business Training and Mentoring: Experimental Evidence from Women-Owned Microenterprises in Ethiopia,"Recent research shows that microenterprises in developing countries are constrained by their managerial capacity, especially in the areas of marketing, record keeping, financial planning, and stock control. In a stratified randomized controlled trial, experienced businesswomen in Ethiopia were given formal business training that addressed these constraints. A second-stage mentoring component in which a random selection of female mentees within the social and business network of the trainees from the first-stage business training received customized mentoring from these trained mentors. Pooled results using three rounds of posttraining surveys carried out over 3 years show that business training causes profit and sales to improve by 0.21 standard deviations, while business practices improve by 0.13 standard deviations. The overall impact of mentoring is muted—strong impacts are observed on the adoption of business practices among mentees, but there is no statistically significant impact on profits.",2021.0,Economic development and cultural change,Economic Development and Cultural Change,"Eliana Carranza, T.

Modeling and Simulation of Dissemination of Cultivated Land Protection Policies in China,"Cultivated land protection is the top priority of the national economy in China and the livelihood of people. Cultivated land protection policies (CLPP) play an important role in the protection of cultivated land. However, the process of dissemination of CLPP on social networks of farmers has problems, such as distortion of policy content, single dissemination channels, low level of farmers’ knowledge, and low dissemination efficiency. For revealing the characteristics of the dissemination of CLPP in the farmers’ social networks (FSN), this study combines the Suspected–Exposed–Infected–Recovered–Suspected (SEIRS) epidemic model to construct a model of CLPP dissemination suitable for FSN. In addition, a numerical simulation of the dissemination process of CLPP is conducted on the FSN, and the influence of the structural characteristics of the FSN and different model parameters on the dissemination of CLPP is analyzed. Results show that (1) the dissemination rate between farmers in FSN has a significant impact on the scale and speed of CLPP. A greater initial dissemination rate corresponds to faster speed and larger scale of CLPP dissemination. (2) A greater node degree in FSN means stronger dissemination ability for CLPP. Therefore, identifying structural holes (opinion leaders) in FSN can effectively promote the dissemination of CLPP. (3) The SEIRS model can dynamically describe the evolution law of CLPP dissemination process over time through the four states of farmer nodes of suspected, exposed, infected, and recovered. Numerical simulation results show that the immune degradation rate is proportional to CLPP. However, the direct immunization rate is inversely proportional. The increase in immune degradation rate can reduce the number of recovered farmers and improve the efficiency of CLPP dissemination. On the basis of the abovementioned conclusions, this study draws policy recommendations to increase the scale and speed of CLPP dissemination in China.",2021.0,Land,Land,"Xinhai Lu, Yanwei Zhang, Handong Tang",10.3390/LAND10020160,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba8bb283e4013a8be181f390d1aaffcaa7e9bdd7,52.0,10.0,0.0,['Business'],"[{'category': 'Business', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Environmental Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/10/2/160/pdf?version=1612748563,,2021-02-05
The Demand for Advice: Theory and Empirical Evidence from Farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa,"
 Low levels of investment into modern technologies, and limited use of measures that have low monetary cost but the potential for high yields, are often regarded as obstacles to further agricultural development. This paper investigates farmers’ demand for one such measure, namely agricultural advisory services. These have modest (most frequently zero) monetary user cost but, according to some recent research, have the potential to result in large increases of yields. Yet demand for these extension services is often low. We propose that costly attention may be part of the explanation for this. In our model, advisory services are available free of charge, but positive effects on production are only realized if farmers devote attention to listening to and implementing the provided advice. Modeling farmers as rational decision makers facing scarce attention, we identify the circumstances under which farmers may optimally abstain from demanding advisory services. The model complements the insights of other theories commonly used to explain suboptimal farm decisions and outcomes, and generates testable predictions, which are consistent with empirical evidence based on a large farm-level panel dataset from Sub-Saharan Africa.",2021.0,World Bank Economic Review,The World Bank Economic Review,"Dominik Naeher, Matthias Schündeln",10.1596/1813-9450-9532,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14e526e3eaa73e35d235eeee1480d1e8da9fbdb6,84.0,7.0,0.0,['Business'],"[{'category': 'Business', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstreams/bbaae43f-d8e4-5045-926d-0b7ca9295a1b/download,['Book'],2021-02-02

"Irrigation, Technical Efficiency, and Farm Size: The Case of Brazil","In developing countries, irrigation can help to decrease poverty in rural areas through increased employment in the agricultural sector. Evidence shows that irrigation may increase farm productivity and technical efficiency. In this paper, we estimate the effect of irrigation on farm technical efficiency in Brazil using the 2006 Agricultural Census dataset on more than 4 million farms. We estimate a stochastic production frontier at farm level, considering potential selection bias in irrigation adoption. We find that farms using irrigation are on average 2.51% more technically efficient compared to rain-fed farms. Our findings also suggest that while small farms are more efficient than medium and large farms, the largest difference in technical efficiency between rain-fed and irrigated farms is among large farms. Our results indicate that policies that seek to support expansion of irrigation adoption has also the potential to achieve greater rural development given the estimated effects estimated in this paper among very small and small farms, which are more than 70% of the farms in Brazil.",2021.0,Sustainability,Sustainability,"G.

Traditional knowledge affects soil management ability of smallholder farmers in marginal areas,"Soil fertility is key to sustainable intensification of agriculture and food security in sub-Saharan Africa. However, when soil nutrients are not adequately managed, smallholder farming practices slowly erode soils to almost inert systems. This case study contributes to the understanding of such failures in marginal areas. We integrate agronomic and social sciences approaches to explore links between smallholder households’ farming knowledge and soil fertility in an ethnopedological perspective. We interview 280 smallholder households in two areas of the Ethiopian highlands, while collecting measures of 11 soil parameters at their main field. By analyzing soil compositions at tested households, we identify a novel measure of soil management ability, which provides an effective empirical characterization of the soil managing capacity of a household. Regression analysis is used to evaluate the effects of household knowledge on the soil management ability derived from laboratory analysis. Results highlight the complexity of knowledge transmission in low-input remote areas. We are able to disentangle a home learning and a social learning dimension of the household knowledge and appraise how they can result in virtuous and vicious cycles of soil management ability. We show that higher soil management ability is associated with farmers relying to a great extent on farming knowledge acquired within the household, as a result of practices slowly elaborated over the years. Conversely, lower soil management ability is linked to households valuing substantially farming knowledge acquired through neighbors and social gatherings. The present study is the first to formulate the concept of soil management ability and to investigate the effects of the presence and the types of farming knowledge on the soil management ability of smallholder farmers in remote areas. We show that farming knowledge has a primary role on soil fertility and we advise its consideration in agricultural development policies.",2021.0,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,"M.

Human Capital and Eco-Contractual Governance in Small Farms in Poland: Simultaneous Confirmatory Factor Analysis with Ordinal Variables,"Human capital (HC) plays an important role in modern agriculture. The difference in efficiency of assets explains only about a half of the economic performance of agricultural farms, while the other half relies on HC. Although education and training are the main components of HC, it may also be viewed from the perspective of behavioral theories that were taken under consideration in this study. The role of HC in sustainable farming has not been sufficiently explained when it comes to contractual governance (CG). In this study, the meaning of contractual governance was extended and the eco-contractual governance (ECG) concept was proposed, which stands for CG induced by agri-environmental contracts. The main objective of the article is to confirm the latent concepts of HC and ECG and to verify their correlation in view of the standards imposed by the agricultural policy. To achieve this goal, a structural equation model was developed and simultaneous confirmatory factor analysis with ordinal variables was carried out based on the sample of 674 small farms in Poland. The analysis has confirmed a relatively strong correlation between HC and ECG. It was revealed that training plays a crucial role in this relationship, while economic dependence on agricultural policy weakens the effectiveness of both HC and ECG.",2021.0,,Agriculture,"B.

The Determinants of Sustainable Agricultural Technology Adoption,"Pertanian memiliki peran penting karena lebih dari 60% populasi dunia bergantung pada pertanian sebagai mata pencaharian. Salah satu faktor penyumbang  besar terhadap pertumbuhan produktivitas pertanian adalah penerapan teknologi baru.  Teknologi baru pertanian diharapkan berperan sebagai jalan penting untuk keluar dari kemiskinan di sebagian besar negara berkembang. Namun, realita menunjukkan tingkat adopsi teknologi pertanian dianggap masih relatif rendah. Makalah ini merupakan scientific review yang merangkum dan menganalisis hasil-hasil penelitian tentang adopsi teknologi pertanian. Tujuan makalah adalah untuk mengamati pengalaman di sejumlah negara terkait adopsi teknologi pertanian dan menentukan faktor-faktor yang memengaruhi adopsi serta keberlanjutan suatu adopsi teknologi. Hasil studi mengungkapkan bahwa keputusan petani untuk mengadopsi teknologi baru bergantung pada interaksi dinamis antara karakteristik teknologi dan kondisi lingkungannya. Beberapa aspek yang memengaruhi adopsi teknologi pertanian antara lain aspek teknologi, ekonomi dan keuangan, sosial dan kelembagaan, serta usaha pertanian dan karakteristik rumah tangga petani. Namun, penentu adopsi teknologi pertanian tidak selalu tunggal, melainkan kombinasi dari beberapa faktor sehingga untuk memacu adopsi teknologi harus memperhitungkan semua faktor penentunya. Pendekatan yang komprehensif menjadi pilihan terbaik untuk menyebarluaskan teknologi baru pertanian.

The AgTech Startup Perspective to Farmers Ex Ante Acceptance Process of Autonomous Field Robots,"Autonomous vehicles not only provide a new impetus in the development of car models in the automotive industry—even in agriculture there has recently been talk of autonomous field robots (AFR). Great expectations are placed on these digital assistants from a wide variety of perspectives. However, it is still unclear whether they will make the transition from market niches to broad-based distribution. Apart from various factors, this depends on user acceptance of this new technology expected by the innovators, since this is likely to be essential for the further development of AFR. For this purpose, the ex ante user acceptance of farmers from the perspective of various AgTech startups with AFR involvement in Europe was investigated in this exploratory and qualitative study. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) served as the basis for the developed interview guideline. In summary, the results confirm that a variety of factors potentially influence farmer acceptance and AFR diffusion from the perspective of AgTech startups, with perceived usefulness being considered the main motivation for using AFR. The interviewed experts believe that AFR will initially be used in crops that have relatively high costs for crop protection treatments before becoming economically attractive for other crops. The basic prerequisite for a successful market launch is an adjustment of the legal framework, which sets standards in relation to AFR and thus, provides security in the production process. The results could support political decision-makers in dealing with this new technology and AFR manufacturers in the promotion of AFR.",2020.0,,Sustainability,"Friedrich Rübcke von Veltheim, H.

Spatially Mediated Peer Effects in the Adoption of Conservation Agriculture Practices,"Abstract This study uses location-specific data to investigate the role of spatially mediated peer effects in farmers’ adoption of conservation agriculture practices. The literature has shown that farmers trust other farmers and one way to increase conservation practice adoption is through identifying feasible conservation practices in neighboring fields. Estimating this effect can help improve our understanding of what influences the adoption and could play a role in improving federal and local conservation program design. The study finds that although spatial peer effects are important in the adoption of conservation tillage and diverse crop rotation, the scale of peer effects are not substantial.",2020.0,Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics,Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics,"D.

Ecopreneurial Education and Support: Developing the Innovators of Today and Tomorrow,"Entrepreneurship and more, particularly ecopreneurship, are essential to drive the sustainable transitions needed in food supply chains. Existing pedagogic frameworks should address these academic disciplines and they should be embedded in the educational curricula. Even when ideas are formed that can drive sustainable change, the process from ideation to commercialization can be difficult: the so-called “valley of death.” This aim of this conceptual paper is to consider pedagogic and program design and the mechanisms required to enaction of a body of practice around entrepreneurship and, more specifically, ecopreneurship, within academic curricula and associated business incubators. This makes this paper of particular interest for academia, policy makers and industry support sectors alike. An existing university that has both a student enterprise and ecopreneurship program and an established agri-technology business incubator and accelerator is used as a case study to provide insight into how progress from ideation to commercialization can be more readily supported in a university setting. From a pedagogical perspective, it is incumbent to develop new conceptual, methodological and theoretically underpinned spiral pedagogies to teach and support future generations of learners at agricultural and land-based colleges and universities as to how to exploit and take advantage of entrepreneurial and ecopreneurial business opportunities. Productization, too, needs to be embedded into the ecopreneurial pedagogy and also consideration of how businesses and their associated ecopreneurs navigate from ideation to successful product/service commercialization.",2020.0,Sustainability,Sustainability,"L.

Changing agricultural stubble burning practices in the Indo-Gangetic plains: is the Happy Seeder a profitable alternative?,"ABSTRACT Every year after the rice harvest, some 2.5 million farmers in northwest India burn the remaining stubble to prepare their fields for the subsequent wheat crop. Crop residue burning causes massive air pollution affecting millions of people across the Indo-Gangetic Plains. We examine different tillage practices to provide urgently needed empirical evidence on how profitable it is for farmers to adopt no-burn technologies, especially the ‘Happy Seeder’ (HS) which is capable of sowing wheat directly into large amounts of crop residue. Apart from analysing the cost of rice residue management and wheat sowing under conventional-tillage and zero-tillage, we identify factors influencing the adoption of the HS and quantify its impact on wheat yields and –production costs. While we do not find any evidence of a yield penalty, our analysis reveals significant savings in wheat production costs, amounting to 136 USD ha–1. In addition, our analysis shows that the HS saves water and facilitates timely wheat sowing. We conclude that the private benefits of HS use combined with its societal benefits of reducing air pollution and enhancing agricultural sustainability justify particular policy support for its large-scale diffusion, to be supplemented by a stricter enforcement of the ban on residue burning.",2020.0,International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability,International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability,"A.

Conservational tree growing by smallholder farm households: evidence from Gamo highlands of Southern Ethiopia,"Deforestation and environmental degradation were identified among the leading factors worsening risk exposure in developing countries. Conservational tree growing was found a permissible option and an awake up policy direction to curve down the problem in Ethiopia. However, the uptake of this practice is far from complete and the art has not been made to a level that could make households self-reliant at least in tree resources, particularly in the highlands. The objective of this study was to identify the decisive factors that influence conservational tree growing behavior of smallholder farm households in Gamo highlands of Southern Ethiopia. The study was based on survey data collected from 11 villages in 2011/2012. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 335 farm households. Structured interview questionnaires and observations were used to collect primary data. Descriptive and inferential statistics and logistic regression model were used to analyze the data. The key findings showed that a host of factors significantly influenced smallholders’ decision to practice conservational tree growing. The study found that tree growing experience, farm size, and availability of suitable land area for tree growing and cash income from sales of trees were the significant factors explaining the variation in conservational tree growing behavior of households. We also observed old-aged trees in traditionally protected areas. Among others, funeral and mystical sites host large number of long-lived indigenous tree species than private farms in Gamo highlands of southern Ethiopia. Based on the findings, the study concluded that intra-farmer experience sharing, and support to efficient indigenous institutions and rural tree markets as potential entry points for mitigating deforestation and developing environmentally sustainable agriculture.",2020.0,Environmental Systems Research,Environmental Systems Research,"Malebo Mancha Massa, A.

A systematic review of employment outcomes from youth skills training programmes in agriculture in low- and middle-income countries,"Engagement of youth in agriculture in low- and middle-income countries may offer opportunities to curb underemployment, urban migration, disillusionment of youth and social unrest, as well as to lift individuals and communities from poverty and hunger. Lack of education or skills training has been cited as a challenge to engage youth in the sector. Here we systematically interrogate the literature for the evaluation of skills training programmes for youth in low- and middle-income countries. Sixteen studies—nine quantitative, four qualitative and three mixed methods—from the research and grey literature documented the effects of programmes on outcomes relating to youth engagement, including job creation, income, productivity and entrepreneurship in agriculture. Although we find that skills training programmes report positive effects on our chosen outcomes, like previous systematic reviews we find the topic to chronically lack evaluation. Given the interest that donors and policymakers have in youth engagement in agriculture, our systematic review uncovers a gap in the knowledge of their effectiveness. Youth engagement in agriculture in low- and middle-income countries offers social and economic opportunities, and supports food security. Agriculture skills training is key for youth engagement, yet programmes are not well evaluated for effectiveness in employment outcomes.",2020.0,Nature Food,Nature Food,"W. H. E.

Reviewing the Field of External Knowledge Search for Innovation: Theoretical Underpinnings and Future (Re‐)search Directions,"The field of external knowledge search for innovation has a long tradition and has inspired several schools of thought resulting in a rich and burgeoning body of research. However, the field suffers from two key limitations. First, the pluralism of research across multiple disciplines impedes our attention to the field as a whole, including its intellectual structure and core ideas. Second, recent developments in the business environment and key new ideas in the field complement taken-for-granted approaches and provide new opportunities for knowledge search. Based on a systematic co-citation analysis, we provide a reflective review of the literature and make several contributions. We integrate existing research across disciplines and offer a synthesis of a fragmented research landscape to present a global view of the field. Moreover, we propose a novel external search concept and introduce the idea of “decoupled search.” Leveraging our synthesis and conceptualization further, we recommend future research directions for the entire field of external knowledge search for innovation.",2020.0,The Journal of product innovation management,Journal of Product Innovation Management,"Daniel Ehls, Sara Polier, C.

"The role of the social network structure on the spread of intensive agriculture: an example from Navarre, Spain","Social networks influence decision-making in agricultural landscapes by affecting how farmers access knowledge and resources. However, researchers ignore the disparate structures built to access different kinds of knowledge and resources and the social mechanisms that take place on such farmers’ advice networks. We explored the role of social networks in decision-making among farmers in Navarre (Spain) to understand how and why some practices spread among farming communities. Social network analysis allows us to understand how farmers in this region share both knowledge and resources, and the potential implications of this sharing for the landscape. We find that large-scale farmers undertaking intensive land management are at the core of the network in this region, controlling the flow of knowledge and resources related to farm management, policy, technology, and finance. The central position of these farmers in the social network, and their reputation, is key to the spread of intensive farming practices in the region, which ultimately may lead to homogenization of local agricultural landscapes. Understanding farmer network structures in a context of agricultural intensification can help tease out the social mechanisms, such as farmers joining each other in cooperatives, behind the spread of agricultural practices.",2020.0,Regional Environmental Change,Regional Environmental Change,"Amaia Albizua, E.

Land Rights and Technology Adoption: Improved Rice Varieties in Vietnam,"Abstract Adopting improved seed varieties is a type of agricultural investment that has substantially ensured food security in developing countries and helped farmers transition out of poverty. This paper examines the impact of land rights on the adoption of high-yield rice varieties by farmers in Vietnam. Using panel data from representative surveys of Vietnamese households, I find that having land-use certificates has a positive influence on households’ adoption of improved rice varieties. Additionally, I explore the channels through which land rights affect improved seeds adoption. Within households, having a land title matters at the plot level, which suggests the significance of the tenure security channel. I also find evidences of the credit channel, in which holding land titles encourages a household to take loans for rice production.",2020.0,Journal of Development Studies,The Journal of Development Studies,Linh Nguyen,10.1080/00220388.2019.1677889,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1690a84a9c5861dcd90f30c3c69fd7cb42fce17c,21.0,8.0,0.0,['Business'],"[{'category': 'Business', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Land_Rights_and_Technology_Adoption_Improved_Rice_Varieties_in_Vietnam/10112777/1/files/18228227.pdf,['Review'],2020-08-02

"Caste, Social Networks and Variety Adoption","Social networks influence technology diffusion but targeting formal leaders (institutional central nodes) may lead to distributional consequences. This paper analyzes the role of informal social networks in technology diffusion in a socially hierarchical caste-based society. Often, information flow and technology diffusion are constrained by social and economic boundaries where informal nodes such as caste play a very decisive role in everyday life. Proper targeting and dissemination of technology to the marginalized sections of society are very important for their development. We observed that only one-fourth of farmers cultivate newer varieties which include hybrids and recently released high yielding varieties. The results showed that individuals belonging to marginal groups are influential and act as informal leaders when they are the dominant caste in the village. Progressive farmers are found to fail in disseminating new varieties, and targeting influential informal leaders who belong to the dominant caste of the village appears to be a better strategy. Among non-dominant caste members, influential leaders belonging to Other Backward Classes (OBCs) or Scheduled Tribes (STs) are more desirable targets than other caste groups.

Learn or react? An experimental study of preventive health decision making,"Despite public health efforts, uptake of preventive health technologies remains low in many settings. In this paper, we develop a formal model of prevention and test it through a laboratory experiment. In the model, rational agents decide whether to take up health technologies that reduce, but do not eliminate the risk of adverse health events. As long as agents are sufficiently risk averse and priors are diffuse, we show that initial uptake of effective technologies will be limited. Over time, the model predicts that take-up will decline as users with negative experiences revise their effectiveness priors towards zero. In our laboratory experiments, we find initial uptake rates between 65 and 80% for effective technologies with substantial declines over time, consistent with the model’s predictions. We also find evidence of decision-making not consistent with our model: subjects respond most strongly to the most recent health outcomes, and react to negative health outcomes by increasing their willingness to invest in prevention, even when health risks without prevention are known by all subjects.

Zero-tillage wheat provides stable yield and economic benefits under diverse growing season climates in the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains,"ABSTRACT Sustainably enhancing wheat productivity in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) is vital for ensuring future food security. While in controlled field trials zero-tillage (ZT) wheat has demonstrated considerable yield benefits, empirical assessments of the performance stability of the practice in farmers’ fields under varying climatic conditions are lacking. Given progressive climate change, this constitutes an important knowledge gap which we address with a unique panel dataset from 961 farm households in Bihar, India, spanning two favourable and two less favourable growing seasons. We employ an endogenous switching regression (ESR) framework to derive unbiased estimates of the expected impacts of ZT on wheat yields and production costs among the farming population (average treatment effect, ATE). The prevailing ZT practices led to significant yield gains in three out of the four years, notably in the less favourable seasons. Overall, the estimated yield ATE was 660 kg ha−1. More importantly from the farmers’ perspective, ZT led to significant cost savings in all four seasons, commensurate to a 5% increase in average total household incomes. We conclude that ZT for wheat in Bihar provides tangible and consistent benefits to farmers. Policy-makers in Bihar and adjacent states should continue to strongly support its adoption at scale.",2020.0,International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability,International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability,"A.

Socio-Economic Dimensions of Adoption of Conservation Practices: What Is Needed to Be Done?,"Promoting sustainable agricultural production requires farmers to adopt new technologies such as organic farming to increase the agricultural productivity, while conserving the environment. Adoption and diffusion of new technologies need a long process, as experienced in the past. There are social and economic factors, identified in the literature, and those could cause delays in farmers’ use of new technologies. Hence, technology adoption and diffusion are important policy issues in agriculture. For that reason, this paper provides a literature review including factors influencing the adoption and diffusion of technology in agriculture and aims to contribute to the future studies and policies, especially focusing on the social capital or the social aspects, which are proven not to be analyzed by the previous studies comprehensively. The results show that interaction with neighbors and relatives, and membership in a group or organization, which represent the social aspects, has a positive influence on adoption and diffusion of new technologies. Hence, policy-makers should incorporate the social aspects when designing the policies, such as cost sharing programmes, to promote adoption and diffusion of new technologies.",2020.0,Organic Agriculture,Organic Agriculture,"N.

Social network and extension service in farmers’ agricultural technology adoption efficiency,"The purpose of the article is to analyze the interaction effect between social network and extension service in farmers’ agricultural technology adoption efficiency (TAE). The empirical analysis refers to samples of farmers’ water-saving irrigation technology (WSIT) adoption from Minqin, China. The result indicates that social network and extension service can improve farmers’ TAE, but they are found to be competitive from the perspective of overall social network. While from the perspective of four dimensions of social network, interaction and trust have positive effects on farmers’ TAE, and learning and trust are found to be competitive with extension service. The policy implication describes as follows. First, government should pay attention to farmers’ social learning and demonstration effect. And series of measures should be taken to cultivate farmers’ social network. Second, extension service should be improved to satisfy farmers’ multiple demand on agricultural technology. Third, government should combine the effects of social network and extension service, and make different promotion strategies for different regions. In addition, other influential factors cannot be ignored.",2020.0,PLoS ONE,PLoS ONE,"Geling Wang, Q. Lu, S.

Diversification is in the Detail: Accounting for Crop System Heterogeneity to Inform Diversification Policies in Malawi and Zambia,"Abstract Crop diversification is a common agricultural policy objective. However, the determinants and impacts of crop diversification are heterogeneous and depend on a range of crop-specific characteristics. Index-based measurements of crop diversification, common in the agriculture economics literature, are unable to account for this heterogeneity. Using two national panel surveys from Malawi and Zambia, we develop a multinomial treatment effects model to examine the determinants of adopting seven discreet cropping systems and their impacts on maize productivity and crop income stability. The results of this approach are compared to those obtained when using a Gini–Simpsons index. Differences between the two empirical approaches highlight the importance of accounting for cropping system heterogeneity when conducting analyses of crop diversification to inform policy. For example, in Zambia, we show that levels of output market competition have no significant effect on diversification when diversification is measured as an index. However, at a cropping system level increased private trader activity is associated with a reduced probability of adopting subsistence-oriented cropping systems and an increased probability of adopting more productive and commercialised systems.",2020.0,,The Journal of Development Studies,"Giuseppe Maggio, N.

We show that the optimal self-enforcing arrangement can be implemented by providing vendors with a line of credit and the option to buy additional units at a fixed price. Moreover, the structure of this arrangement is optimal both for profit-maximizing firms and for nonprofit organizations with limited resources. We test the arrangement using a field experiment in rural Uganda. We find that the model-implied optimal arrangement increased distribution significantly compared to a standard contract. However, growth was lower than predicted by the model because vendors were unwilling to extend credit to customers and did not have access to a reliable savings technology. We discuss several recent technological innovations that help to overcome both of these challenges.

Understanding the Interdependence and Temporal Dynamics of Smallholders’ Adoption of Soil Conservation Practices: Evidence from Nigeria,"The adoption of soil conservation practices is widely recognized as essential in improving soil fertility and promoting climate-smart agriculture in general. Yet, smallholders’ adoption of soil conservation practices in Sub-Saharan Africa has not been adequately documented, especially in relation to the interdependence and temporal dynamics of adoption decisions. In this paper, we analyze the interdependence and temporal dynamics of smallholders’ adoption of soil conservation practices, such as animal manure, crop residue retention, intercropping, and crop rotation in northern Nigeria. We use data from two rounds of a farm-household panel survey among maize-based farming households and estimate econometric models, including pooled multivariate probit and random effects ordered probit. We found that there is a significant positive correlation between the soil conservation practices, suggesting that adoption decisions for these practices are interrelated and the practices are considered complements by the farmers. We found evidence of inter-temporal variability in the adoption of soil conservation practices, which suggests that some farmers do switch in and out of these practices and may likely explain the often-reported variability in maize yields. Also, we found that the farmers’ decisions to adopt soil conservation practices and the intensity of adoption are influenced by several factors, including farmer-, household-, farm-, institutional-, and biophysical-level factors. Yet, the factors that significantly influence the likelihood of adoption differ slightly from those that influence the intensity of adoption. Policy interventions to enhance the adoption intensity of conservation practices should strongly leverage important factors, such as contract farming, crop–livestock integration, and off-farm income diversification.",2020.0,Sustainability,Sustainability,"Tolulope Oladimeji, O.

Revitalizing cultivation and strengthening the seed systems of fonio and Bambara groundnut in Mali through a community biodiversity management approach,"Abstract Fonio (Digitaria exilis (Kippist) Stapf) and Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.) are native crops grown at a small scale in Mali that have potential to support agricultural productivity under climate change. A community biodiversity management approach was explored in this study as a means to reinforce the cultivation of these crops by increasing farmers' access to intraspecific diversity and developing capacities of community institutions for their management. The research involved six communities in Ségou and Sikasso regions. Multiple varieties of fonio (10–12) and Bambara groundnut (8–12) were established in diversity fields in each site over 2 years where farmers engaged in experiential learning over the crop cycle. Significant adoption of fonio and Bambara groundnut was detected in several study sites. The precise drivers of adoption cannot be definitively determined but likely include increased seed access and awareness gained through the diversity field fora, seed fairs and community seed banks. No significant yield advantage was detected for any of the varieties in the diversity fields, which showed variable performance by site and year. The number of varieties registered and managed by community seed banks in each site increased from 1–5 varieties of each crop to 11–12 varieties following the interventions. The number of Bambara groundnut varieties cultivated in farmers' fields also increased, while there was evidence of a slight decline in fonio diversity in some communities. The results of this study can inform efforts to strengthen seed systems and cultivation of neglected and underutilized species in Africa.",2020.0,Plant genetic resources,Plant Genetic Resources: Characterization and Utilization,"A.

Salt-tolerant rice variety adoption in the Mekong River Delta: Farmer adaptation to sea-level rise,"Rice production in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam (MRD) is endangered by sea-level rise and an associated increase in the incidence of salinity intrusion. This paper examines the diffusion of salt tolerant rice varieties in the MRD that were promoted through Consortium for Unfavorable Rice Environments (CURE) activities. Factors associated with adoption of CURE-related varieties are estimated using a random utilty model and a dataset of 800 farm households with rice fields in salinity prone areas of the MRD. Results suggest that there has been widespread adoption of CURE-related varieties in salinity-prone areas. Further, multivariate analysis reveals that environment and location characteristics, rather than household characteristics, are the most important determinants of adoption. In particular, CURE-related varieties are more likely to be adopted in high-salinity-risk areas that are not protected by salinity barrier gates. Neighbhors’ adoption decisions also strongly influence household decisions to adopt CURE-related varieties. The contracting of mechanization, particularly for land preparation and harvest, requires the coordination of village households in timing of planting, harvest and varietal duration. This coordination appears to extend to choice of CURE-related varieties. Finally, CURE-related varieties and other varieties generate similar net revenues in a year with low salinity exposure, suggesting that CURE-related varieties are a low-cost insurance policy against salinity inundation in high risk areas. Combined, these results highlight the need to address complex factors beyond current economic profits, like environment, community choices, and risk mitigation, when designing technologies and policies that support farmer adaptation to climatic change.",2020.0,PLoS ONE,PLoS ONE,"S.

Does training location matter? Evidence from a randomized field experiment in Rural Indonesia,"Informal network helps disseminate agricultural knowledge in the rural area where formal extension is lacking. However, how the interplay between formal training and informal network promotes technology adoption is still under-studied. This paper aims to examine the effects of training locations upon knowledge and adoption of agricultural techniques via strengthened informal and formal social networks. We administer agricultural training of identical contents in farmers’ hometown and in more remote but advanced locations and arrange farmers to travel to the respective locations. Then, we examine locational heterogeneity effects upon conservation and plant-rehabilitation techniques, and social network variables with formal extension services, informal network, and between participants and non-participants. Only farmers trained in the most remote location increase the size and depth of social network with their peers, extension expert, and non-participants upon returning from training. These changes in social networks may encourage them to adopt the technology. While formal training is important for knowledge diffusion, informal network is the key for successful adoption, and these networks are strengthened via training held in the most remote location.",2020.0,,Agricultural and Food Economics,"Ayu Pratiwi, A.

"Analysis, Estimation, and Validation of Discrete-Time Epidemic Processes","Models of spreading processes over nontrivial networks are commonly motivated by modeling and analysis of biological networks, computer networks, and human contact networks. However, learning the spread parameters of such models has not yet been explored in detail, and the models have not been validated by real data. In this paper, we present several different spread models from the literature and explore their relationships to each other; for one of these processes, we present a sufficient condition for asymptotic stability of the healthy equilibrium, show that the condition is necessary and sufficient for uniqueness of the healthy equilibrium, and present necessary and sufficient conditions for estimating the spread parameters. Finally, we employ two real data sets, one from John Snow’s seminal work on cholera epidemics in London in the 1850s and the other one from the United States Department of Agriculture, to validate an approximation of a well-studied network-dependent susceptible-infected-susceptible model.",2020.0,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,"Philip E.

"Structural Transition in Crop Composition in Chumphon Province, Thailand","This study captures the structural transformation in crop composition in Chumphon Province in southern Thailand at the macro (province) and micro (farm household/plot) levels. Based on the decomposition of crop production value growth into the effects of price, productivity, area reallocation between crops, and enlargement of the total area, production at the province level has been found to be driven by price and productivity effects for the past two decades. This raises the question of how farmers obtain crop price or technical information for crop choice decisions. In our original survey, farm or plot-level crop diversification was studied in villages where coffee production was historically active. We found that the capacity for diversification differs according to farm scale, and information use regarding crop price or farming practices is highly dependent on informal social networks. Furthermore, the role of social relationships in information sharing on price and farming practices of a specific crop is important even for farmers who do not produce that crop, suggesting that social relationships are the effective channel for the promotion of crop diversification and sustainable farming practices.",2019.0,Agricultural Information Research,Agricultural Information Research,"Kanjana Kwanmuang, Apinya Wangyeesen, H.

Networks and economic policy,"Over the past two decades, economists have made significant advances in understanding how networks affect individual behaviour and shape aggregate outcomes. We argue that insights from network economics can play an important role in the design of economic policy. Focusing on six policy domains, we show that network economics not only deepens our understanding of existing policy concerns but also suggests a number of new policy questions. In each of these policy areas, we evaluate the availability of data and assess the suitability of the network economics toolkit for policy work. We conclude with a discussion of challenges to the adoption of network-based methods in economic policy along with strategies to overcome them.",2019.0,Oxford review of economic policy,Oxford Review of Economic Policy,"M.

Fattening Pig Farmers’ Intention to Participate in Animal Welfare Programs,"Simple Summary The demand for products with higher farm animal welfare (FAW) standards is increasing within the European Union. In response, representatives from agricultural associations, the slaughtering industry and food retailing started the industry solution Initiative Animal Welfare (IAW) in 2015 with the aim of establishing higher FAW standards on a broad basis in both poultry and pig production in Germany. In contrast to other available animal welfare programs (AWPs), the IAW receives considerable support from farmers and enjoys a large number of participants. This article focuses on the question why the IAW is gaining positive resonance among German livestock farmers. Applying partial least squares path modeling to analyze the determinants of farmers’ intention to participate in the IAW, we found that the determinants performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, price value, trust and experiences with the IAW have a significant influence on the behavioral intention to participate in the IAW program. It is shown that the farmers’ hedonic motivation has the greatest impact on participation. The prospect of improving the image of pig fattening and the economic incentive motivate many farmers to participate. Additionally, many farmers confirmed that they enjoy providing a more superior welfare status to their pigs. The social determinant was also identified as a strong influencing factor. The results suggest that participation in AWPs could be improved by appropriate remuneration and measures promoting farmers’ intrinsic motivation to engage in AWPs. Abstract Farmers are considered a highly important stakeholder group for the successful implementation of higher farm animal welfare (FAW) standards, but so far little is known about their attitudes and the determinants of their participation in programs that request higher FAW standards. To close this research gap, fattening pig farmers in Germany were questioned via a large-scale online survey in 2018 (n = 239). Based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, a partial least squares path modeling (PLS) was run. Results show that the expected performance as well as the expected costs associated with the Initiative Animal Welfare (IAW) substantially influence fattening pig farmers’ behavioral intention to participate in the IAW. Furthermore, the decision is influenced by social determinants and facilitating conditions such as deadweight effects. Farmers’ hedonic motivation, fair remuneration and previous experiences with the establishment of higher FAW standards can influence their intention to take part in the IAW. In addition, farmers’ trust in the program is a major determinant. There are also moderating variables such as age and work experience that influence farmers’ intention to take part in the IAW. Our results have important managerial implications for the IAW and can help to design further tailor-made animal welfare programs (AWPs) that fulfill the requirements of both fattening pig farmers and the broader public not only in Germany but the European Union.",2019.0,Animals,Animals : an Open Access Journal from MDPI,"Sirkka Schukat, Alina Kuhlmann, H.

Marvel of Technology Social Media: An Insight into the Honeycomb Framework of Social Media,"We live in a technological jungle where virtuality is present in a form of social media but, still at a complex stage. That complexity can be decoded with the use of honeycomb structure of social media given by J.H. Kietzmann et al. Social media can be called as a marvel of technology because it offers an impressive quantity of information on users and their interactions with society by providing many fresh possibilities for study exploration to researchers, economists and statisticians and many others and we tried to find out the possibility by using the social media model of Kietzmann et al The model reflects the strategies adopted by different social networks to help them out to engage with customers. The purpose of this research is to address the different characteristics or functional construction blocks of social media (i.e., identity, conversations, sharing, presence, relationships, reputation or groups) of a social media honeycomb model is helpful in developing brand awareness and engaging with customers. A survey based empirical study with N=191 social media users was conducted by using a structured questionnaire. Correlation matrix was used to find the connection between the different functional blocks of the model of social media.

Harvesting Prosperity: Technology and Productivity Growth in Agriculture,"This is the Preliminary Version for a book expected in November 2019. This book documents frontier knowledge on the drivers of agriculture productivity to derive pragmatic policy advice for governments and development partners on reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The analysis describes global trends and long-term sources of total factor productivity growth, along with broad trends in partial factor productivity for land and labor, revisiting the question of scale economies in farming. Technology is central to growth in agricultural productivity, yet across many parts of the developing world, readily available technology is never taken up. We investigate demand-side constraints of the technology equation to analyze factors that might influence producers, particularly poor producers, to adopt modern technology. Agriculture and food systems are rapidly transforming, characterized by shifting food preferences, the rise and growing sophistication of value chains, the increasing globalization of agriculture, and the expanding role of the public and private sectors in bringing about efficient and more rapid productivity growth. In light of this transformation, the analysis focuses on the supply side of the technology equation, exploring how the enabling environment and regulations related to trade and intellectual property rights stimulate Research and Development to raise productivity. The book also discusses emerging developments in modern value chains that contribute to rising productivity. This book is the fourth volume of the World Bank Productivity Project, which seeks to bring frontier thinking on the measurement and determinants of productivity to global policy makers.",2019.0,,,"K.

Learning adaptation to climate change from past climate extremes:,"Conservation agriculture-based wheat production system (CAW) can serve as an ex ante measure to minimize loss due to climate risks, especially the extreme rainfall during the wheat production season in India. This study aims to examine whether farmers learn from their past experiences of exposure to climate extremes and use the knowledge to better adapt to future climate extremes.,The authors used data collected from 184 farmers from Haryana over three consecutive wheat seasons from 2013-2014 to 2015-2016 and multivariate logit model to analyse the driver of the adoption of CAW as an ex ante climate risk mitigating strategies based on their learning and censored Tobit model to analyse the intensity of adoption of CAW as an ex ante climate risk mitigation strategy. Farmer’s knowledge and key barriers to the adoption of CAW were determined through focus group discussions.,The analysis shows that the majority of farmers who had applied CAW in the year 2014-2015 (a year with untimely excess rainfall during the wheat season) have continued to practice CAW and have increased the proportion of land area allocated to it. Many farmers shifted from CTW to CAW in 2015-2016.,While farmers now consider CAW as an ex ante measure to climate risks, a technology knowledge gap exists, which limits its adoption. Therefore, designing appropriate methods to communicate scientific evidence is crucial.,This paper uses three years panel data from 184 farm households in Haryana, India, together with focus groups discussions with farmers and interviews with key informants to assess if farmers learn adaptation to climate change from past climate extremes.",2019.0,,International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management,"J.

The effect of peer observation on consumption choices: evidence from a lab-in-field experiment,"ABSTRACT We investigate the impact of peer observation on consumption decisions using a lab-in-field experiment. Respondents make consumption decisions either alone or under peer observation. We find evidence for peer effects. We are able to study these further by looking into the mechanism and performing detailed heterogeneity analysis. Concerning the mechanisms, we find evidence for an information channel. Further, we show that the consumption choice is influenced by how many people made the same decision previously, but not by who those people are, hence finding evidence of a psychological channel. Respondents with higher cognitive ability are less susceptible to peer effects, while people living in small villages are more susceptible.",2019.0,Applied Economics,Applied Economics,"Antonia Grohmann, Sahra Sakha",10.1080/00036846.2019.1638499,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36a099a5e7da086092745647d1cdb27066b0de79,46.0,8.0,0.0,"['Economics', 'Psychology']","[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Psychology', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00036846.2019.1638499?needAccess=true,,2019-08-04
"Can women's self‐help groups improve access to information, decision‐making, and agricultural practices? The Indian case","Abstract Effective agricultural extension is key to improving productivity, increasing farmers’ access to information, and promoting more diverse sets of crops and improved methods of cultivation. In India, however, the coverage of agricultural extension workers and the relevance of extension advice is poor. We investigate whether a women's self‐help group (SHG) platform could be an effective way of improving access to information, women's empowerment in agriculture, agricultural practices, and production diversity. We use cross‐sectional data on close to 1,000 women from five states in India and employ nearest‐neighbor matching models to match SHG and non‐SHG women along a range of observed characteristics. We find that participation in an SHG increases women's access to information and their participation in some agricultural decisions, but has limited impact on agricultural practices or outcomes, possibly due to financial constraints, social norms, and women's domestic responsibilities. SHGs need to go beyond provision of information to changing the dynamics around women's participation in agriculture to effectively translate knowledge into practice.",2019.0,Agricultural Economics,"Agricultural Economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","K.

"Economic Analysis of Supply Functions, Private Returns to Investment in Education and Skill Mismatch in Egypt","Education provides good health, empowerment and employment to all people in the society. Accordingly, education can make a lifelong difference in individuals’ lives. It is proved that, on average, there is a positive relationship between each additional year of schooling and the income of an individual. The main objective of this paper is to estimate the demand and supply functions for schooling in Egypt using the data of the Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey 2012. It is estimated that the private rate of return to education is 4.5%. Moreover, the rate of return to the number of years of experience is 2.6%, i.e. each additional year of experience will increase the earnings of an individual by 2.6% on average. It is concluded that individuals from poor families have an increased likelihood of receiving financial aid, which decreases their discounting rate of interest.",2019.0,European Journal of Government and Economics,European Journal of Government and Economics,M.

Do Beliefs About Herbicide Quality Correspond with Actual Quality in Local Markets? Evidence from Uganda,"Abstract Adoption of modern agricultural inputs in Africa remains low, restraining agricultural productivity and poverty reduction. Low quality agricultural inputs may in part explain low adoption rates, but only if farmers are aware that some inputs are low quality. We report the results of laboratory tests of the quality of glyphosate herbicide in Uganda and investigate whether farmers’ beliefs about the prevalence of counterfeiting and adulteration are consistent with the prevalence of low quality in their local market. We find that the average bottle in our sample is missing 15 per cent of the active ingredient and 31 per cent of samples contain less than 75 per cent of the ingredient advertised. Farmers believe 41 per cent of herbicide is counterfeit or adulterated. Beliefs are significantly correlated with quality at the local market level, but beliefs remain inaccurate, adjusting for only a fraction of actual differences in quality. Price is also significantly correlated with quality in local markets, but prices also adjust for only a fraction of quality differences. Although, like fertiliser and hybrid maize seed, herbicide in Uganda is low quality, herbicide use is substantially higher.",2019.0,,The Journal of Development Studies,"Maha Ashour, D.

Direct and Spillover Effects of Agricultural Technology Adoption Programs: Experimental Evidence from the Dominican Republic,"This paper estimates the impact of an agricultural technology adoption program on agricultural production and income using an experimental approach. The context of analysis is the Program for the Support of Innovation in Agricultural Technology (PATCA II) implemented in the Dominican Republic. The program aimed to increase the agricultural productivity and income of smallholder farmers by encouraging the adoption of a technology. We exploit a two-stage randomized experiment conducted at the geographic and farmer levels to estimate the effects of adopting improved pasture and irrigation technologies. To measure the effectiveness of the program, we combined rich microeconomic data obtained from a comprehensive household survey with administrative data to measure both direct and spillover effects. The sample includes 2,499 farmers, including direct beneficiaries, indirect beneficiaries, controls, and farmers within the social network of direct beneficiaries. We find different patterns of adoption and significant impacts on production-related outcomes for both of the technologies analyzed. The results show adoption of improved pastures increased agricultural income and that the effects intensify over time. In the case of irrigation, treatment had adverse effects on total household income and agricultural production; however, there is evidence of a change in the production portfolio of program beneficiaries from temporary to permanent crops as a function of time of exposure to the technology. Whereas irrigation can be implemented immediately after treatment, income benefits take time to materialize, for instance, as permanent crops reach the initial point of harvest or maturity. These results imply the existence of a dynamic learning-by-doing process. Also, the assessment of indirect or spillover effects did not validate the hypotheses that knowledge spillovers might take place among farmers in close geographical and social proximity to program beneficiaries. The results present evidence that liquidity constraints are critical determinants of technology adoption for smallholder farmers in the Dominican Republic.",2019.0,,,"Julián Aramburu, Lucas Figal Garone, A.

Education Spillovers in Farm Productivity: Revisiting the Evidence,"
 This paper exploits the social organization of India to revisit the question of education spillovers in farm productivity. The fact that social interactions mainly occur within castes in rural India provides tools to show that the observed correlation between farm productivity and neighbors’ education is likely to be a spillover effect. In particular, there are no cross-caste and no cross-occupation effects, which underlines that, under specific assumptions, which are stated and explored in the paper, the education of neighbors does not capture the effect of group unobservables. This evidence is complemented by separate estimations by crops, which show results that are consistent with education spillovers.

Determinants of agricultural technology adoption: Farm households evidence from Niger,"This paper investigates the determinants of agricultural technology adoption decisions taken by Nigerian farm households such as improved seeds, inorganic fertilizers and plant protection products. We use the multinomial probit model on cross-sectional data of 1395 farm households that are representative of farm household in Niger. According to the type of agricultural technology, the results showed that agricultural technology adoption decisions taken by farm households were determined by the age and education level of the farm household head, the size of the farm household, the membership of agricultural cooperative, the number of plots owned, the level of farm household income and wealth, the plot size, the types of soil on the plot, the plots located on the valley and gentle slope, and the land tenure status.

How Do Farmers Learn From Extension Services?: Evidence From Malawi,"Agricultural extension services can play an important role in increasing farmer yields and incomes yet evidence of the effectiveness of extension services in Sub-Saharan Africa has been mixed. We study farmers learning about agricultural technologies using a (quasi) randomized controlled trial in which farmers differ in their exposure to commonly used extension methods that range in their intensity of interaction. We find that farmers who participated in season-long farmer-led demonstration plot cultivation learn about the critical adoption details of production processes and adopt more components of a new, multi-component technology. Farmers invited to attend farmer field day events learn considerably less about production process details. Building on qualitative interviews, we then develop a two-stage learning process in which farmers first form yield expectations and then choose how much to invest in learning the details of the production processes subject to yield beliefs and the learning costs. We test this model using detailed data on beliefs, knowledge, adoption and constraints and find evidence that farmers yield beliefs hinge around observed yield, and these observed yields affect learning efforts.",2018.0,American Journal of Agricultural Economics,Food Politics & Sociology eJournal,"A.

Investigating Key Factors Influencing Farming Decisions Based on Soil Testing and Fertilizer Recommendation Facilities (STFRF)—A Case Study on Rural Bangladesh,"Proper nourishment is fundamental for satisfactory crop growth and production. However, for efficient crop production, it is important to understand the soil environment, to recognize the limitations of that environment, and to ameliorate them where possible without damaging the soil quality. Soil testing and fertilizer recommendation facilities (STFRF) can help farmers to achieve environmental and economic sustainability by assisting them in recognizing their soil condition, reducing agrochemicals usage, using an appropriate amount of fertilizer, minimizing input costs, and achieving higher yield. These facilities are not new in the context of Bangladesh, yet the adoption rate among farmers is low and its determinants have rarely been empirically tested based on microlevel data. Therefore, this study examined those factors underlying the adoption of soil testing and fertilizer recommendation facilities using field surveyed data of 176 individual farmers. Our evidence shows that young farmers with less farming experience are more likely to adopt these facilities. Additionally, being small-scale farmers, having higher education, having more farming income, and having more knowledge about these facilities and the fees of these facilities were found to have a significant effect on the adoption. On the other hand, gender, land ownership, and secondary income were found to be insignificant with regard to the adoption of soil testing and fertilizer recommendation facilities. Our results also revealed that most adopter farmers not only focused on profitability, but were additionally concerned with environmental well-being.",2018.0,Sustainability,Sustainability,"Faruque-As-Sunny, Zuhui Huang, T.

"Linking Risk Aversion, Time Preference and Fertiliser Use in Burkina Faso","Abstract This paper investigates whether Burkinabe maize farmers’ fertiliser-use decisions are correlated with their risk and time preferences. We conducted a survey and a series of hypothetical experiments on a sample of 1500 farmers. We find that more patient farmers do use more fertiliser, but it is only because they plant more maize (a fertiliser-intensive crop) rather than because they use more fertiliser per hectare of maize planted. Conversely, we find no statistically significant link between risk aversion and fertiliser use. We use a simple two-period model, which suggests that risk aversion may indeed have an ambiguous effect on fertiliser use.",2018.0,,The Journal of Development Studies,"Tristan Le Cotty, Élodie Maître d’Hôtel, R.

Misperceived Quality: Fertilizer in Tanzania,"Fertilizer use remains below recommended rates in most of Sub-Saharan Africa, contributing to poor crop yields and poverty. Farmers voice suspicion that available fertilizer is often adulterated, but these concerns are not backed by reliable evidence. In fact, an insight from industry but absent from academic literature is that profitable fertilizer adulteration is difficult. We surveyed all fertilizer sellers in Morogoro Region, Tanzania and tested 633 samples of their fertilizer. We also conducted a willingness-to-pay assessment with farmers. We find that fertilizers meet nutrient standards but that belief of rampant product adulteration persists among farmers. We find evidence of a quality inference problem in the market: 25% of fertilizer has deteriorated in observable ways and farmers rely on these observable attributes to (incorrectly) assess unobservable nutrient quality. We show that this misperception likely reduces technology adoption beyond the effect of nutrient quality being unobservable.",2018.0,Journal of Development Economics,EcoRN: Soil Ecology (Topic),"H.

Vanishing Returns? Potential Returns and Constraints to Input Adoption Among Smallholder Farmers in Uganda,"This paper estimates the profitability of fertilizer and hybrid seeds in Uganda, using agronomic evidence on the yield returns to inputs from experimental fields, as well as output price data from local markets between 2000 and 2012. The results suggest that the returns to fertilizer are positive across the entire price range for beans, maize, and matooke and positive for the top 75 percent of prices for coffee. Commonly available improved seed varieties for maize and beans increase gains by 32 percent on average. However, accounting for the quality of the inputs available to farmers in the market, the sizable positive returns become negative for most of the price distribution, possibly explaining the low adoption of inputs in Uganda. The paper also examines the impact of other factors that could affect input adoption, by using a relatively long panel data set spanning 12 years. The analysis finds evidence that enhanced access to economic markets and past weather conditions have small effects on input use, and positive correlations between the use of extension services and knowledge and input use.",2018.0,,World Bank Policy Research Working Paper Series,"R.

Weather risk: how does it change the yield benefits of nitrogen fertilizer and improved maize varieties in sub-Saharan Africa?,"The purpose of this research was to explore how weather risk affects the value of nitrogen fertilizer use and improved seed variety adoption to sub‐Saharan African (SSA) maize farmers. It contributes to the literature by providing additional broad support for the hypothesis that low rates of fertilizer use and improved seed variety adoption can be attributed to the fact that the SSA landscape is heterogeneous, so fertilizer and improved seed are not always advantageous, especially when considering the potentially high cost to farmers of obtaining fertilizer and improved seed. The analysis finds a synergy between nitrogen fertilizer and improved seed varieties. While the benefits of nitrogen tend to increase overtime without improved seed varieties and the benefits of improved seed varieties tend to decrease overtime without nitrogen, combining the two provides more sustained productivity benefits. Therefore, securing both nitrogen use and improved seed variety adoption is important for promoting sustained maize productivity increases across much of SSA. The research also contributes to the literature by using a methodology for calculating willingness to pay bounds that assess the importance of farmers’ risk tolerances as a barrier to fertilizer use or improved seed variety adoption.",2018.0,Agricultural Economics,Agricultural Economics,"T.

"Market Returns, External Pressure, and Safe Pesticide Practice—Moderation Role of Information Acquisition","The main objective of this study is to examine how market returns and external pressure influence farmers’ standardized pesticide application and to investigate the moderating role of information acquisition. Data were collected from 986 farmers following a multi-stage sampling method from five major agricultural provinces in China. A hierarchical regression analysis was performed to test the hypothesis. The results show that market returns and information acquisition of pesticide application had a significant and positive influence on standardized pesticide application.

Increasing paddy yields and improving farm management: results from participatory experiments with good agricultural practices (GAP) in Tanzania,"Rice is an increasingly important commodity in sub-Saharan Africa. In Tanzania, the rice yield gap is as high as 87%, due to a combination of production constraints and sub-optimal crop management. Reducing this yield gap may be partly achieved through the introduction and dissemination of good agricultural practices (GAP). We conducted 18 farmer-managed on-farm trials in Tanzania, to test a set of GAP components against conventional farmers’ practices (FP) for two consecutive growing seasons in 2013 and 2014. The objectives were: (1) to understand farmers’ capabilities in implementing GAP; (2) to acquire better insights into the merits, relevance and suitability of individual GAP components; and (3) to provide a case study showing that exposure to good practices combined with the farmers’ own experimentations can serve to improve and, trigger a positive change in the participating farmers’ crop management. Compared to the farmers’ own practices, average yield increases of 1 t paddy ha−1 in 2013 and 2.7 t ha−1 in 2014 were achieved when following GAP. These yield advantages were mainly obtained by a higher panicle number, improved harvest index and improved weed control. Farmers experienced difficulties with land levelling, planting or sowing in lines and using rotary weeders, but they were convinced that these technologies are important to boost their rice yields. The case of Tanzania shows that paddy yields can be substantially improved by GAP and that adoption of GAP by smallholder rice farmers can be triggered by stimulating experimentations with such practices on their own farms.",2018.0,Paddy and Water Environment,Paddy and Water Environment,"K.

The Secret to Getting Ahead Is Getting Started: Early Impacts of a Rural Development Project,"Interventions in rural development projects vary in their likely time to impact. Some offer rapid payoffs after minimal learning and investment, while others offer larger payoffs but entail delays and may require learning or significant investment of labor and capital. Short-term impacts included reductions in stored grain losses due to improved silos and increase in household savings due to increased participation in savings groups. The least poor are most likely to invest labor and capital in slow-to-accrue payoffs like soil erosion abatement from building conservation structures.

Does Spatial Dependence Affect the Intention to Make Land Available for Bioenergy Crops,"We find spatial dependence in landownersâ€™ stated intentions to make land available for bioenergy crops. Our data are generated from a contingent valuation survey of 599 owners of marginal land in southern Michigan. Employing a Bayesian framework and using these spatially explicit data, we estimate and compare nonâ€ spatial probit and spatial Durbin probit models to examine the presence of spatial dependence in land rental intentions. Results show that intentions to rent land for bioenergy crop production are spatially dependent. This spatial dependence arises both from the land supply intentions of nearby landowners and from spatial spillover effects of landowner characteristics and attitudes towards environmental amenities and the disamenities of land rental. We show that ignoring spatial dependence in the intentions of neighbouring landowners to participate in land rental markets for bioenergy feedstocks can lead to distortions that underestimate total effects. Our finding implies that studies of land use and crop supply should test for spatial interactions in order to make accurate inferences.",2018.0,,Journal of Agricultural Economics,"T.

"Short Communication: The tolerance level of local sorghum genotypes from Sabu-Raijua and Belu Districts, Indonesia to saline soil","Benggu YI, Nguru ESO. 2018. The tolerance level of local sorghum genotypes from Sabu-Raijua and Belu Districts, Indonesia to saline soil. Trop Drylands 2: 1-4. A study aimed to determine the level of tolerance of local sorghum from Sabu-Raijua and Belu Districts to saline soil had been conducted in the experimental field and soil chemistry laboratory of Agriculture Faculty, Universitas Nusa Cendana, from June to October 2016. The study was designed in a factorial treatment design laid out in a completely randomized design with 15 treatments and three replications. The first factor was the variety of sorghum, consisting of three levels: local sorghum from Sabu-Raijua, local sorghum from Belu, Numbu variety. The second factor was the salinity levels of Vertisol, composed of five levels, i.e., 0, 6, 8, 10 and 12 mmos.cm-1. Variables observed were plant height, number of leaves, flowering date, and seed dry weight. Analysis of variance was conducted followed by Tukey test (5%). The result showed that there was an interaction effect between sorghum variety and salinity level of soil on all variables observed. In general, all varieties of sorghum grew normally with soil salinity level ranged from 0 to 8 mmos.cm-1.

Review: Agriculture-industry linkage and technology adoption in Ethiopia: Challenges and opportunities,"Sisay T. 2018. Review: Agriculture-industry linkage and technology adoption in Ethiopia: Challenges and opportunities. Trop Drylands 2: 18-27. High rate of agricultural growth has far-reaching positive implications for economic development of low-income countries in terms of increasing employment and accelerating poverty reduction. For Ethiopia to achieve middle-income status by 2025 and make substantial inroads against food insecurity, concerted and strategic investment and strategic choices in the agricultural sector are vital. Agricultural linkage encloses generating and transferring agricultural technologies to enhance productivity, reduce loss, and improve the livelihoods of beneficiaries as well as the country’s economy. The objective of this paper was to review the current status of linkage between agriculture-industry actors, extent of technology adoption system, challenges and opportunities in Ethiopia. The result of the review study shows that different factors are constraining the system. Most of the agriculture industry linkage and technologies promoted through the extension system and adoption levels are far below the possible expectation in the country. Agriculture research industries lack effective mechanisms of transferring their technologies to the end users, inadequate technological skilled manpower, poor market linkage between technology multiplication enterprises and technology users, lack of responsible body to transfer technology were the major challenges in Ethiopia. Factors constraining the linkage between stakeholders and technology adoption level of Universities, TEVTs, agriculture Research institutions and agriculture sector are wide ranging from poor linkage between stakeholders and weak involvement of professionals are among the main problems that constraining the system. Weak link between research, education, and extension and the contact of these organizations have with farmers is among the main bottlenecks in agricultural technology development, adoption level. Therefore, strong University and Research-industry linkage is needed in the country.",2018.0,Tropical Drylands,Tropical Drylands,Tilahun Sisay,10.13057/tropdrylands/t020104,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/728e04cc6a05e94cc70556151723459e6d22de18,49.0,8.0,0.0,['Business'],"[{'category': 'Business', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://doi.org/10.13057/tropdrylands/t020104,['Review'],2018-06-01

Adoption of High-Yielding Groundnut Varieties: The Sustainability of a Farmer-Led Multiplication-Dissemination Program in Eastern Uganda,"This study examines the adoption of high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of groundnut by smallholders in eastern Uganda. The primary focus of this work is the analysis of the sustainability of impacts from a regional farmer-led HYV dissemination and multiplication program. Data collected in 2014 is used to determine the lasting impact of the program conducted a decade prior, from 2001 to 2004. The structure of the data, which includes a treatment and 2-part control group, is critical to the identification of project impacts, measured as groundnut land allocation to groundnut HYVs (%). Fractional regression, propensity score matching and instrumental variable techniques are utilized to address potential bias from model specification, selection, and endogeneity. We find that, on average, participating households allocated 21% more of their land in groundnuts to HYVs relative to controls. Diffusion of program benefits through spillover is revealed by statistically significant differences in mean adoption between neighbor and non-neighbor controls, such that benefits are transferred from participants to their neighbors but not to the non-neighbor control group. We also find that, because of seed saving practices, the average yield for HYVs decreased over time to levels below those obtained from landrace varieties. Thus, the program effectively aided in information dissemination and technology transfer within rural communities. However, additional knowledge transfer is critical to the sustainability of food security outcomes among participant farmers.",2018.0,,Sustainability,"J. Jelliffe, B. Bravo‐Ureta, C. Deom, D.

Social Interactions and Spillover Effects in Chinese Family Farming,"Abstract This paper aims to test the effects of social interaction and input spillovers on the agricultural performance of family farms in mixed paddy rice production (organic and conventional farming). Using survey panel data from a Chinese village, we adopt a Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) derived from spatial econometrics to disentangle the social interaction effect from spillover effects and to control for technological heterogeneities. Our analysis reveals a negative social interaction effect indicating that an increase in the yield of neighbouring plots leads to a decrease in the yield of the plot itself. We also find input spillovers. Labour, capital costs, water and organic pesticides have positive spillovers while external nutrients (nitrogen and phosphate) have negative spillover effects. Our study thus calls for a better understanding of social interactions and spillover effects among farmers in the promotion of sustainable family farming.",2018.0,,The Journal of Development Studies,"Huanxiu Guo, S.

The Making of Behavioral Development Economics,"A core insight from early behavioral economics is that much of human judgment and behavior is influenced by""fast thinking""that is intuitive, associative, and automatic; very little human thinking resembles the rational thinking that characterizes homo economicus. What is less well-recognized is that innate reliance on cognitive shortcuts means that cultural mental models --categories, concepts, social identities, narratives, and worldviews -- profoundly influence judgment and behavior. Individuals have a cultural""toolkit""or""repertoire""of mental models that they use to perceive and interpret a situation and construct a response. Many researchers have connected cultural mental models to economic development, yet they rarely identify their research findings as""behavioral""economics. This research constitutes a second strand of behavioral economics that illuminates the tight interlinkages between preferences, culture, and institutions and points to new policy opportunities. It brings the discipline almost full circle back to 18th and 19th century perspectives. This essay cautions against strong reductionism in which sociological influences on decision making are squeezed into a rational actor model.",2018.0,,Development Economics: Microeconomic Issues in Developing Economies eJournal,"Allison Demeritt, K.

Variability of Greenhouse Gas Footprints of Field Tomatoes Grown for Processing: Interyear and Intercountry Assessment,"Our study provides an integrated analysis of the variability of greenhouse gas (GHG) footprints of field-grown tomatoes for processing. The global farm-specific data set of 890 observations across 14 countries over a three-year period (2013–2015) was obtained from farms grown under Unilever’s sustainable agricultural code. It represents on average 3% of the annual global production of processing tomatoes: insights can be used to help inform corporate sourcing strategies and certification schemes. The median GHG footprint ranged from 18 in Chile to 61 kg CO2-equiv per tonne of tomatoes in India, lower than results reported in other studies. We found that footprints are more consistent within countries than between them. Using linear mixed effect models, we quantified the relative influence of environmental conditions and farm management factors. Key variables were area of production and the method of fertilizer application. GHG footprints decreased with increasing area of production to a threshold of 17.4 ha. Farms using single fertilizer application methods in general had a larger GHG footprint than those using a combination of methods. We conclude that farm management factors should be prioritized for future data collection, and more stringent guidance on acceptable practices is required if greater comparability of outcomes is needed either within a scheme, such as the Unilever’s sustainable agriculture code, or between schemes.",2017.0,Environmental Science and Technology,Environmental Science & Technology,"Wan Yee Lam, R. van Zelm, A.

Coordination of Cooperative Knowledge Creation for Agricultural Technology Diffusion in China’s “Company Plus Farmers” Organizations,"Cooperative knowledge creation is important for the promotion of agricultural technology diffusion in “company plus farmers” alliance organizations in China. A coordination mechanism is necessary to improve cooperative knowledge creation. A game model was developed to explain the mechanism. The model’s equilibrium was analyzed in noncoordination and coordination scenarios. Eight propositions and two corollaries were proposed and then verified by numeric analysis. We found that (1) the coordination of cooperative knowledge creation is valuable for increasing profit in agricultural technology diffusion; (2) companies and farmers are playing a game, and subsidy coefficients and degree of effort mainly influence their decisions; (3) key factors in the game are success probability and profit sharing proportion that influence the profits of a company and the farmers; (4) discount factors also influence profits, but do not influence the total profit in the coordination scenario; and (5) enhancing success probability, choosing a proper profit sharing proportion, and improving other parameters would be beneficial to the development of knowledge creation, as well as agricultural knowledge diffusion.

Case studies on the nature, use and availability of extension advice in six irrigation schemes in Tanzania, Mozambique and Zimbabwe are presented. The use of government extension officers varied significantly, with extension use not linked to farm outcomes.

Efficient Public Good Provision in Networks: Revisiting the Lindahl Solution,"The provision of public goods in developing countries is a central challenge. This paper studies a model where each agent’s effort provides heterogeneous benefits to the others, inducing a network of opportunities for favor-trading. We focus on a classical efficient benchmark – the Lindahl solution – that can be derived from a bargaining game. Does the optimistic assumption that agents use an efficient mechanism (rather than succumbing to the tragedy of the commons) imply incentives for efficient investment in the technology that is used to produce the public goods? To show that the answer is no in general, we give comparative statics of the Lindahl solution which have natural network interpretations. We then suggest some welfare-improving interventions.",2017.0,,ERN: Public Goods & International Public Goods (Topic),Anil Jain,10.17016/IFDP.2017.1210,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/745bf1f1502f1978595ddab580ec5c56f0fe15c7,12.0,0.0,0.0,['Economics'],"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://doi.org/10.17016/ifdp.2017.1210,,2017-07-28
Zero-tillage is a proven technology for sustainable wheat intensification in the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains: what determines farmer awareness and adoption?,"In India, there is increasing recognition among policy-makers of the largely untapped potential of the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) for meeting state- and national-level food needs. Zero-tillage (ZT) is a proven technology for enhancing wheat productivity and, hence, food security in the IGP, while reducing production costs – a ‘win-win’ scenario that should support rapid technology scaling even though adoption remains modest to date. In order to inform policies and derive recommendations for a more effective extension strategy, this study investigated determinants of ZT adoption in the Eastern IGP using a random sample of 1000 wheat-growing households from Bihar, stratified by ZT adoption status. We corrected for potential non-exposure bias by using a two-stage estimation procedure that differentiates between factors affecting farmers’ awareness of ZT and those affecting adoption conditional on awareness. Owing to the relatively nascent stage of ZT diffusion in the area, we emphasized the role of information in the adoption process, including social networks, whereby we allowed for endogenous and exogenous network effects. Only 44% of sample households knew about ZT technology, and there was substantial scale bias in favor of larger scale farmers both with respect to awareness and adoption. Both the adoption behavior and characteristics of the respondents’ network members influenced their own awareness and adoption of ZT, particularly among farmers in the smallest landholding tercile. Farmers valued the time-saving potential of ZT, especially under conditions of increasingly unreliable monsoon rains resulting in a delayed rice crop and, consequently, late establishment of wheat which reduces yield. The fact that most farmers accessed ZT via custom-hire services was accounted for in the model, and the importance of proximate service providers confirmed. We conclude that there is need for further awareness-raising campaigns for ZT technology, whereby, apart from mass media, agricultural extension should use contact farmers belonging to different social strata for effective within-village diffusion of messages, especially to the poorer farmers. The social inclusiveness of ZT use can be enhanced by supporting the emergence of more ZT service providers and by developing business models that lower the transaction costs of servicing smaller farms.",2017.0,Food Security,Food Security,"A.

Connecting smallholder tomato producers to improved seed in West Africa,"AbstractBackgroundEnvironmental heterogeneity, emerging pathogens and limited access to financial and agricultural inputs prevent farmers from producing consistent crop yields in many developing countries. Yield 
instability impedes establishment of processing and export industries, thereby inhibiting economic development. Modern varieties offer significant increases in yield stability.
ResultsA deeply collaborative, multi-national germplasm trialing network was established in West Africa to identify tomato varieties well adapted to each country and mobilize those varieties into local seed distribution networks alongside an integrated pest management program. Research partners in seven West African countries evaluated over 100 tomato varieties for resistance to tomato leaf curl disease (ToLCD). Using biotechnology, the identity and distribution of the key viruses (begomoviruses) causing ToLCD in these countries were identified, and a vector-independent inoculation method (agroinoculation) was developed. The trials identified a set of high-performing varieties with resistance. Agroinoculation with the three prevalent begomoviruses confirmed resistance.
ConclusionsThese trial results fulfill the new Economic Community of West African States harmonized seed regulation policy, which requires at least 2 years of national performance trials prior to commercialization of a tomato variety. To compete with a rapidly expanding canned tomato import industry, West African growers need to increase productivity and processing capacity; therefore, we also assessed processing and export trade data for fresh and processed tomatoes from each of the seven countries.",2017.0,Agriculture & Food Security,Agriculture & Food Security,"Kari W Perez, Jeffrey S.

From Mines and Wells to Well-Built Minds: Turning Sub-Saharan Africa's Natural Resource Wealth into Human Capital,"Sub-Saharan Africa's natural resource-rich countries have poor human development. Children in these countries are more likely to die before their first birthday, more likely to be stunted, and less likely to attend school than children in other countries with similar income. Despite the current price downturn, extractives will remain an important part of Sub-Saharan Africa's growth story—using resource rents wisely remains a long term challenge.Governments must choose how to allocate resource rents between spending, investing in human or physical capital, or investing in global financial assets. The return to investing in physical and human capital will be high in countries where the capital stock is low. Moreover, higher levels of human capital make investments in physical capital more productive, which suggests that the optimal portfolio will involve investing in both. Human capital should be prioritized in many of Sub-Saharan Africa’s resource-rich countries because of the low starting point. Investing effectively in human capital is hard because it involves delivering services, which means coordinating a large number of actors and activities. Three dimensions of governance are key: institutions, incentives and information. Decentralization and leveraging the private sector are entry points to reforming institutional structures. Revenues from natural resources can fund financial incentives to strengthen performance or demand. Producing information, making it available, and increasing social accountability helps citizens understand their rights and hold governments and providers accountable. Improving the quality of education and health services is central to improving human capital. Two additional areas are promising. First, early child development—mother and newborn health, and early child nutrition, care, and education—improves outcomes in childhood and later on. Second, cash transfers—either conditional or unconditional—reduce poverty, increase household investments in child education, nutrition, and health, and increase the investment in productive assets which foster further income generation.",2017.0,,,"B.

What Does Literature Say About the Determinants jig of Adoption of Agricultural Technologies by Smallholders Farmers,"Understanding the determinants of adoption of agricultural technologies is essential in planning and executing technology related programmes for meeting the challenges of food production in developing countries. This study therefore extensively reviewed the various factors influencing adoption of agricultural technology among smallholder farmers. Results of the findings show that changes in technology adoption are associated with changes in the economic situation of the country, financial status of farm households and the net gain from adopting the technology, access to credit, access to information, travel cost, characteristics of the technology, scale of operation of the farmers, income, cultural norms and values, social network and human specific factors. The findings will be useful to technology developers, disseminators, and the end users (farmers). To increase the likelihood of adoption of the modern agricultural technologies by smallholders, policy makers should make credit accessible to farmers without gender discriminations, make information about the technology available via extension services, advice farmers to improve their educational level and carry the end users along while developing the technology.",2017.0,,,Obayelu Ae,10.19080/ARTOAJ.2017.06.555676,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8c3220a8ca49e30448dc88dac36bccd166af199b,53.0,27.0,1.0,['Engineering'],"[{'category': 'Engineering', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://juniperpublishers.com/artoaj/pdf/ARTOAJ.MS.ID.555676.pdf,['Review'],2017-04-21

Effects of farmers’ social networks on knowledge acquisition: lessons from agricultural training in rural Indonesia,"Agricultural information is transferred through social interactions; therefore, ties to agricultural informants and network structures within farmers’ local neighborhoods determine their information-gathering abilities. This paper uses a spatial autoregressive model that takes account of spatial autocorrelation to examine such network connections, including friendship networks and advice networks, upon farmers’ knowledge-gathering abilities during formal agricultural training. We found that peer advice networks are important to support knowledge-gathering activities, while friendship networks are not. Further examination of network structures confirms that farmers who occupy a central position in their local neighborhood networks are found to perform better in learning outcomes to some extent, indicating that local network position is positively related to problem-solving ability in an unknown environment outside their locale.",2017.0,,Journal of Economic Structures,"Ayu Pratiwi, A.

"Competências organizacionais, trajetória tecnológica e aprendizado local na agricultura: o paradoxo de Prebisch","O tema da inovacao tecnologica na agricultura e tratado na literatura economica primordialmente no debate sobre o desenvolvimento economico, com destaque dado aos problemas dos paises perifericos. Para entender a evolucao do moderno setor agricola, e necessario um enfoque mais amplo de debate, o qual remete ao paradoxo de Prebisch: o setor agricola e capaz de gerar progresso tecnico e valor agregado, bem como promover o desenvolvimento de regioes agroexportadoras. A inovacao tecnologica nao implica somente na aquisicao de insumos modernos, mas na gestao do conhecimento tacito e especifico incorporado nas tecnologias. A capacidade de inovar depende do gerenciamento produtivo dos agricultores. O produtor investe no intuito de incorporar novas tecnologias, aumentar o aprendizado e ampliar a capacidade de absorcao de conhecimento.

Many Chinese scholars had done many researches about the agricultural science and technology innovation. Numerous scholars got much valuable research conclusions for improving the construction of agricultural science and technology innovation system. However, there were still some problems existing in the current agricultural science research system, such as that the agricultural science and technology studies were divorced from the agricultural production, the mechanism of the market was still imperfect, there was an unreasonable layout in the agricultural science and technology. Th erefore, we wanted to know the dynamic and the evolution path of the international agricultural science and technology innovation. What is more, we wanted to know whether there was a signifi cant diff erence between the domestic and overseas agricultural science and technology innovation and if the international experience was good for the development of the Chinese agricultural science and technology innovation.

Production risk and adoption of irrigation technology: evidence from small-scale farmers in Chile,"In most developing countries non-irrigation status often dominates adoption of traditional and modern irrigation technology. In this paper, we study the effect of production risk on irrigation technology choice among small-scale farmers in Chile, applying sample selection and discrete choice models. We find that more educated farmers, with credit access, receiving extension services, and living in communes with more adopters are more likely to use modern irrigation techniques. Moreover, production risk is often associated with adoption of traditional irrigation, and this risk often undermines a shift to more modern irrigation systems. Controlling for pre-conditions that determine irrigation choices clearly improves our understanding of small-scale farmer irrigation adoption decisions and we argue that weaker knowledge about and lower automatic diffusion of modern irrigation is a main obstacle for improving small-scale farmer productivity.",2016.0,,Latin American Economic Review,"C.

Acceptance and Practices on New Paddy Seed Variety Among Farmers in MADA Granary Area,"This paper employed survey data to identify farmers’ acceptance and practices on new paddy seed variety in MADA granary area in Kedah Malaysia. 250 of respondents who are paddy farmers in four districts area (Perlis, Jitra, Pendang and Kota Sarang Semut) were involved in this interview. The objective of the study was to obtain farmers’ acceptance and practices on new paddy seed variety. The results show that socio- demographic of respondents in MADA area represents 93.2% of respondents are male and the rest of 6.8% are female farmers. The most predominant age group of the respondents between 51 to 60 years old which are 37.6%. For the marital status of the respondents, there were 64.4% are married, 15.6% are single and 20% are widow and widower. 29.6% respondents went to primary schools while about 50.8% went to secondary schools. Meanwhile, 12.4% had college/university education and only 7.2% did not get any formal education. The overall mean for perception level toward advantage and disadvantage rice variety selected is 3.902 considered as a high level of perception. Meanwhile, for chi-square analysis, it illustrates a significant different on age and years of involvement towards a level of practices on using new paddy seed variety.

Third-party facilitation of supply chain linkages: evidence from the Armenian vegetable industry,"This paper presents an empirical examination of investment responses to external facilitation of supply chain linkages between agricultural producers and processors. Specifically, it analyzes the impact of participation in the USDA Marketing Assistance Program (MAP) facilitated formal marketing channel on farm-level investments in tomato production. The analysis involves mixed method approach utilizing a case of the USDA MAP in the Armenian vegetable industry and the survey data from 427 Armenian tomato growers. The main results indicate that the tomato growers linked to USDA MAP facilitated formal marketing channel (i.e. processors) invested significantly more in expanding tomato planting area compared to growers in informal channel (i.e. direct-to-consumer markets, middleman, and barter). The lessons from the USDA MAP’s supply chain facilitation strategy and the results of quantitative analysis provide insights on incentive structures and enforcement mechanisms for designing more effective supply chain ...",2016.0,,Journal on Chain and Network Science,"Aleksan Shanoyan, R.

Knowledge flows and linkage with universities: the vision of Mexican farmers,"This paper is about the linkage between academia and the productive sector in agriculture, focusing on the farmers’ point of view regarding this linkage. It also explores another dimension of knowledge transfer: the links that farmers establish with their peers to share the knowledge they acquire. Two research questions guided this study: (1) What characteristics influence the propensity of a farmer to engage in direct links with researchers? and (2) What characteristics influence the propensity of a farmer to share (transfer) knowledge with other farmers? This paper is based on original micro data obtained from a survey of Mexican farmers in 2011. The Mexican case is interesting for different reasons: it is a large country with large scientific capacities in the agricultural sciences; there is a large number of small farmers living in rural areas—both commercial and subsistence, and agro exports make a contribution to the export structure. Hence, more knowledge flows are needed for the development process. The research questions are approached through a model with a binary dependent variable to analyse the variables that explain the likelihood that a farmer establishes links directly with researchers, and a model with a multinomial distribution in order to observe the determinants of knowledge transfers made by farmers among their peers. The main finding is that training, participation in farmer organisations and the geographical location matter to explain the probability that a farmer establishes links with researchers. Concerning to the propensity of knowledge sharing with other farmers, belonging to organizations that include a variety of agents related to the innovation process and a set of idiosyncratic factors specific to the region (e.g. a more communal type of culture) are relevant for this matter.",2016.0,,Brazilian Journal of Science and Technology,"G.

Knowledge Diffusion and the Adoption of Fertilizer Microdosing in Northwest Benin,"Soil degradation and low crop productivity negatively affect the food security of smallholder farmers in West Africa. Various agricultural techniques have been developed as components of food security interventions, but their effectiveness in addressing food insecurity in part depends upon farmers’ abilities to adopt these techniques. In this paper we present the results of a social network analysis that tracked the flow of information on fertilizer microdosing from our Project Research team (PRs) to Demonstration Farmers (DFs), and from DFs to other Village Farmers (VF) in the village of Koumagou B in northwest Benin. Our findings indicate that both adoption and project awareness of microdosing were low following two years of field trails. Overall, the DFs failed to spread information or promote learning over the trial period, with only 3 of 20 DFs diffusing knowledge to a significant degree (i.e., out-degree >5). After 2 years of trials, the efforts of PRs and DFs were insufficient to mobilize the network to adopt the microdosing technique.",2016.0,,Sustainable Agriculture Research,"D. Natcher, E.

The Role of Social Network and Regional System in Maintaining Livelihood Security of Smallholder Farmers in Central Kenya,"Taking smallholder settlements constituting a relatively compact set of two newly settled villages adjacent Northeastern Slopes of Aberdare, Central Kenya as the main research field, the study: investigates the migration patterns, kinship relations and emerging associational life in the study sites; explores the social networks underpinning the exchange and sharing of information and knowledge by the smallholder farmers; and illuminates the functioning of the regional system driven by local-level area differences arising from ecological gradient of a mountain slope. It draws from both qualitative and quantitative data collected from field surveys between 2007 and 2009. Additional field work was conducted intermitted between 2010 and 2012. Findings reveal that lack of land and the ensuing process of migration led to geographical dispersal of household members and breakdown of common household residence formerly a basis for primary bonds and cohesiveness of the kinship system. Thus, kinship relations have weakened and in their place emerged new associational life at the destination areas for coping with and adapting to uncertainties in the new environment. These local-based associations in the new settlements have Original Research Article Kauti; AJAEES, 8(3): xxx-xxx, 2016; Article no.AJAEES.20368 2 replaced the functions of kinship, market and the state in securing livelihoods for the smallholders. Findings on social networks using the case of seed sources information sharing attest to the fact that, farmers are less dependent on social relations in provision of crop varieties and livestock breeds and are highly dependent on market mechanism, an evidence of farmer’s exposure to variable market forces. However, they are continuously engaged in social learning process. The functioning of the regional system revealed a complementary relationship among the studied settlements especially during crisis times such as drought whereby upland farmers have economic, social, and ecological relationships with lowland farmers. Even though the study is limited to the local scope, it provides a basis for designing policies aimed at rural livelihood security improvement and informs and facilitates targeting of outside interventions such as food security programs which can be built on existing social networks and regional system.",2016.0,,"Asian Journal of Agricultural Extension, Economics and Sociology",M.

Household-Level Determinants of Soil and Water Conservation Adoption Phases: Evidence from North-Western Ethiopian Highlands,"Soil and water conservation (SWC) practices have been promoted in the highlands of Ethiopia during the last four decades. However, the level of adoption of SWC practices varies greatly. This paper examines the drivers of different stages of adoption of SWC technologies in the north-western highlands of Ethiopia. This study is based on a detailed farm survey among 298 households in three watersheds. Simple descriptive statistics were applied to analyze the stages of adoption. An ordered probit model was used to analyze the drivers of different stages of adoption of SWC. This model is used to analyze more than two outcomes of an ordinal dependent variable. The results indicate that sampled households are found in different phases of adoption, i.e., dis-adoption/non-adoption (18.5 %), initial adoption (30.5 %), actual adoption (20.1 %), and final adoption (30.9 %). The results of the ordered probit model show that some socio-economic and institutional factors affect the adoption phases of SWC differently. Farm labor, parcel size, ownership of tools, training in SWC, presence of SWC program, social capital (e.g., cooperation with adjacent farm owners), labor sharing scheme, and perception of erosion problem have a significant positive influence on actual and final adoption phases of SWC. In addition, the final adoption phase of SWC is positively associated with tenure security, cultivated land sizes, parcel slope, and perception on SWC profitability. Policy makers should take into consideration factors affecting (continued) adoption of SWC such as profitability, tenure security, social capital, technical support, and resource endowments (e.g., tools and labor) when designing and implementing SWC policies and programs.",2015.0,Environmental Management,Environmental Management,"A.

Factors Affecting the Fertilizer-use Decision of Maize Farmers in Ghana,"This work examines the factors that influence whether or not a farmer applies inorganic fertilizer in the Ghanaian context. Current maize yields in Ghana average only one-third of their estimated potential, but this yield gap can be reduced by improving farming practices and growing conditions in Ghana; specifically, yields in Ghana can likely be increased by intensifying the use of inorganic fertilizer, other inputs, and irrigation systems. Recently, Ghana introduced a fertilizer subsidy program to help increase fertilizer-use rates. This paper examines alternate instruments for increasing fertilizer use by determining farm-holder characteristics correlated with inorganic fertilizer use. The results show that the farmer's distance from the closest weekly market, whether the farmer has a pre-harvest contract, and whether the farmer has property rights on the field have a significant effect on fertilizer use.",2015.0,,Journal of Sustainable Development,"A.

"Beer, Wood, and Welfare ‒ The Impact of Improved Stove Use Among Dolo-Beer Breweries","Local beer breweries in Burkina Faso absorb a considerable amount of urban woodfuel demand. We assess the woodfuel savings caused by the adoption of improved brewing stoves by these micro-breweries and estimate the implied welfare effects through the woodfuel market on private households as well as the environmental effect. We find substantial wood savings among the breweries, 36% to 38% if they fully switch to an improved stove. In absolute amounts, they save about 0.176 kg of fuelwood per litre of dolo brewed. These savings imply huge reductions in CO2-emissions and reduce the overall demand for woodfuel, which is predominantly used by the poorer strata for cooking purposes. We provide estimates for the price decrease that might result from this and show that the urban poor are likely to benefit. Thus, the intervention under study is an example for a green growth intervention with pro-poor welfare gains – something green growth strategies should look for.",2015.0,PLoS ONE,PLoS ONE,"M.

Organizational Barriers to Technology Adoption: Evidence from Soccer-Ball Producers in Pakistan,"This article studies technology adoption in a cluster of soccer-ball producers in Sialkot, Pakistan. We invented a new cutting technology that reduces waste of the primary raw material and gave the technology to a random subset of producers. Despite the clear net benefits for nearly all firms, after 15 months take-up remained puzzlingly low. We hypothesize that an important reason for the lack of adoption is a misalignment of incentives within firms: the key employees (cutters and printers) are typically paid piece rates, with no incentive to reduce waste, and the new technology slows them down, at least initially. Fearing reductions in their effective wage, employees resist adoption in various ways, including by misinforming owners about the value of the technology. To investigate this hypothesis, we implemented a second experiment among the firms that originally received the technology: we offered one cutter and one printer per firm a lump-sum payment, approximately a month’s earnings, conditional on demonstrating competence in using the technology in the presence of the owner. This incentive payment, small from the point of view of the firm, had a significant positive effect on adoption. The results suggest that misalignment of incentives within firms is an important barrier to technology adoption in our setting.",2015.0,Social Science Research Network,Organizations & Markets: Formal & Informal Structures eJournal,"D.

Quality and Accountability in Healthcare Delivery: Audit Evidence from Primary Care Providers in India,"This paper presents direct evidence on the quality of health care in low-income settings using a unique and original set of audit studies, where standardized patients were presented to a nearly representative sample of rural public and private primary care providers in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Three main findings are reported. First, private providers are mostly unqualified, but they spent more time with patients and completed more items on a checklist of essential history and examination items than public providers, while being no different in their diagnostic and treatment accuracy. Second, the private practices of qualified public sector doctors were identified and the same doctors exerted higher effort and were more likely to provide correct treatment in their private practices. Third, there is a strong positive correlation between provider effort and prices charged in the private sector, whereas there is no correlation between effort and wages in the public sector. The results suggest that market-based accountability in the unregulated private sector may be providing better incentives for provider effort than administrative accountability in the public sector in this setting. While the overall quality of care is low both sectors, the differences in provider effort may partly explain the dominant market share of fee-charging private providers even in the presence of a system of free public healthcare.",2015.0,,Political Economy: Government Expenditures & Related Policies eJournal,"Jishnu Das, A.

Climate change in Latin America and the Caribbean: policy options and research priorities,"Although climate change is filled with uncertainties, a broad set of policies proposed to address this issue can be grouped in two categories: mitigation and adaptation. Developed countries that are better prepared to cope with climate change have stressed the importance of mitigation, which ideally requires a global agreement that is still lacking. This paper uses a theoretical framework to argue that in the absence of a binding international agreement on mitigation, Latin America should focus mainly on adaptation to cope with the consequences of climate change. This is not a recommendation that such economies indulge in free-riding. Instead, it is based on cost–benefit considerations, all else being equal. Only in the presence of a global binding agreement can the region hope to exploit its comparative advantage in the conservation and management of forests, which are a large carbon sink. The decision of which policies to implement should depend on the results of a thorough cost–benefit analysis of competing projects, yet very little is known or has been carried out in this area to date. Research should be directed toward cost–benefit analysis of alternative climate change policies. Policymakers should compare other investments that are also pressing in the region, such as interventions to reduce water and air pollution, and determine which will render the greatest benefits.",2015.0,,Latin American Economic Review,"Brian Feld, Sebastian Galiani",10.2139/ssrn.2611954,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab8b8fb13f5c26851d1382b3c8622ce53c48fc2d,86.0,19.0,3.0,['Economics'],"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Environmental Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Political Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs40503-015-0028-4.pdf,,2015-05-29

Agricultural Technology Choice and Transport,"&NA; This article seeks to address an old and recurring theme in development economics—the slow adoption of new technologies by farmers in many developing countries. We explore a somewhat novel explanation for this puzzle—the link between market access and the incentives to adopt a new technology when there are non‐convexities. We develop a theoretical model to guide the empirical analysis that uses spatially disaggregated agricultural production data from the International Food Policy Research Institute and Living Standards Measurement Study survey data for Nigeria. We estimate the impact of transport costs on crop production, adoption of modern technologies, and the differential impact on returns of modern versus traditional farmers. To overcome the limitation of data availability on travel costs for much of Africa, we combine road survey data and GIS roads networks to generate the most thorough and accurate road network available, to our knowledge. Using these data and the Highway Development Management Model (HDM‐4), we compute minimum travel costs from each location to the market. Consistent with our theory we find that transportation costs are critical in determining technology choices, with a greater responsiveness among farmers who adopt modern technologies, and at times a perverse (negative) response to lower transport costs among those who employ more traditional techniques. In sum, we present compelling evidence that the constraints to the adoption of modern technologies and access to markets are interconnected, and so should be targeted jointly.",2015.0,,American Journal of Agricultural Economics,"R.

Two-Way Causality between Social Capital and Poverty in Rural Indonesia,"Although the causal effect of social capital on poverty in developing countries has been increasingly documented, the empirical evidence regarding the two-way causality between social capital and poverty is still limited. This study empirically explores the relationship between social capital and poverty in rural areas of Indonesia. Using two nationally representative data sets, this analysis showed social capital defined by participation in social activities positively affects household expenditure (proxy poverty). Besides household expenditure, the findings on the determinants of social capital are (a) well educated (measured by years of formal schooling), (b) the number of social organizations in the village, (c) permanent market infrastructure, and (d) home ownership. These factors constitute a possible means to facilitate poor household access to social capital, which will increase income and reduce poverty especially in rural areas.",2015.0,,Asian Social Science,"Ahmadriswan Nasution, E.

"PRODUCER PARTICIPATION IN BIOMASS MARKETS: FARM FACTORS, MARKET FACTORS, AND CORRELATED CHOICES","Abstract This study evaluates attitudes toward production of three major types of biomass—corncobs, corn stover, and dedicated energy grass—using responses to a mail survey of 2,250 Iowa farmers. We examine how factors influencing willingness to supply biomass vary across biomass types and analyze the presence of potential correlations across interest in growing various types of biomass. We find that correlation in choices across biomass types is strong and statistically significant. Farmers consider corn stover and corncobs as complementary, but dedicated energy grasses and corncobs or stover as substitutes. Factors affecting farmer choices also vary significantly by type of biomass.",2015.0,Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics,Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics,"M. M.

"The Nexus between Agricultural Productivity, Poverty, and Social Services Provision in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Empirical Analysis","This dissertation contains three essays at the interface of agricultural and development economics. The motivation for this lies in the fact that various studies have shown the agricultural sector to be the main income source for the majority of the global poor and it will hence have to play a key role in the fight against global poverty. 
 
The first essay (co-authored by Stephan Klasen) aims to solve a micro-macro paradox on the role of education for agricultural productivity. From a micro perspective, this role is rather unambiguous since the vast majority of studies find that educated farmers exhibit higher levels of agricultural productivity than their uneducated counterparts even after controlling for a variety of potentially important covariates. However, these results stand in sharp contrast to recent cross-country studies applying sophisticated econometric methods which either have not included education variables at all in the model or have only been able to detect insignificant or even puzzling negative coefficients for the education variables used. Against this background, the first essay revisits the importance of education for agricultural productivity from the macro-perspective. Using a panel of 95 developing and emerging countries from 1961 to 2002 that includes data on educational attainment, we show that education indeed has a highly significant, positive effect on agricultural productivity which is robust to the use of different control variables, databases and econometric methods. We can further illustrate that previous macro studies failed to find such an effect due to the inappropriate use of enrolment and literacy indicators. Lastly, extensions to our analysis reveal that only primary and secondary schooling attainment has a significant positive effect on agricultural productivity and that the returns to education (in terms of agricultural productivity) are higher for countries with higher levels of income. 
 
The second essay (co-authored by Stephan Klasen) is a methodological contribution to the literature on pro-poor growth. This essay is motivated by the fact that existing research on this topic focuses too far on income and non-income dimensions of well-being and does not adequately reflect the extraordinary importance of agricultural productivity for poverty reduction worldwide. We suggest that it is straightforward and useful to define the poor not only in terms of income, education or health, but also in terms of agricultural productivity. Such an approach can be readily implemented in the pro-poor growth toolbox by slightly modifying some of the existing tools and allows us to look at pro-poor growth from a complementary, agricultural productivity-based perspective. To illustrate the potential of this extended toolbox, we then apply it to three waves of the nationally representative EICV household surveys from Rwanda (years 1999-2001, 2005-2006, and 2010-2011). The results of our analysis indicate that Rwanda achieved in recent years impressive progress in both, income and non-income dimensions of poverty. The new agricultural productivity-based tools reveal that the labor productivity-poor were able to increase their productivity levels relatively (but not absolutely) faster than the labor productivity-rich. Consistent with the main results from the cross-country analysis in the first essay, our results further indicate considerably lower labor and land productivity levels for human capital-poor households. 
 
The third essay (co-authored by Simon Lange) contributes to a long literature investigating poor households’ ability to smooth consumption in the event of adverse income shocks. This topic is of great importance given that rural households are typically exposed to considerable risks and the need to hold precautionary savings has been found to generate poverty traps by preventing poor agents from undertaking profitable investments. In the West African context, the main forms in which households may hold such extra savings are grain stocks and livestock. One would thus expect that these assets are consumed or sold in times of economic distress. However, empirical studies investigating the role of livestock as a buffer stock are inconclusive. In this essay, we emphasize that there are actually two strands of the literature pursuing slightly different questions (quantities vs. revenues). We address in our empirical analysis both questions at the same time using two large panel household datasets which cover the 2004 drought in the northern provinces of Burkina Faso. Our results with regard to quantities suggest that livestock sales increase significantly in response to adverse rainfall shocks at the province- as well as the household-level and the need to purchase food is the main motive for such extra sales. In contrast, for the second question (focusing on revenues), we find that large parts of an adverse shock to transitory income are passed on to consumption while there is no evidence for additional revenues from livestock sales. We then show that a drought-induced increase in net sales is offset by a concomitant decrease in livestock prices. This price response renders adjustments to livestock holdings a costly strategy to smooth consumption. It also explains why households bear consumption cuts despite livestock holdings that would allow them to completely offset transitory income losses.",2014.0,,,Malte Reimers,10.53846/goediss-4842,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/18140254969906ea0d817299af6cce1b4f790a4a,164.0,0.0,0.0,['Economics'],"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://ediss.uni-goettingen.de/bitstream/11858/00-1735-0000-0023-9972-9/1/Dissertation%20Malte%20Reimers.pdf,['Review'],2014-12-19
Influence of human and physical capital on the survival of new ventures,"El proposito de este estudio es analizar la influencia del capital fisico y humano en la supervivencia de nuevas empresas en diferentes contextos economicos. Para ello, se lleva a cabo un estudio utilizando un modelo logit que analiza las probabilidades de supervivencia de las empresas de nueva creacion. Los resultados muestran que tanto el capital humano como el fisico influyen en la supervivencia de las empresas en el corto y largo plazo, siendo especialmente importante el papel que desempena el capital humano. Las implicaciones del estudio giran en torno a dos hallazgos sustanciales. El primero es que destaca el potencial de los gobiernos en la promocion de formas mas eficientes de emprendimiento. El segundo es que el tipo de motivacion –necesidad u oportunidad– del emprendedor y la importancia de ciertos tipos de capital tambien determinan las probabilidades de supervivencia de las empresas.",2014.0,,,"Lorenzo Revuelto Taboada, Virginia Simón Moya",10.16967/RPE.V2N1A3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e792619a221aec627713483a42acc911d6c6a179,63.0,4.0,0.0,['Political Science'],"[{'category': 'Political Science', 'source': 'external'}]",True,https://revistas.ceipa.edu.co/index.php/perspectiva-empresarial/article/download/45/17,,2014-12-19

Seeing is Believing? Evidence from an Extension Network Experiment,"Farmers' adoption of existing, improved techniques is a central challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa. Extension agents (EAs) are commonly used to disseminate agricultural techniques and technologies. There is no evidence on what activities and incentive mechanisms can make extension services work for farmers. Within an existing extension network in Mozambique, we compare di usion of sustainable land management (SLM) practices in the classic training and visit (TV and (2) a contact farmer (CF) in each community. Yet, the structure of the extension network implemented by the project does not necessarily guarantee a ow of information from CFs to farmers. The GoM worked with a team of researchers from the World Bank and IFPRI to use the MSDVP as a learning vehicle and set up a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to test the e ectiveness of providing a centralized, direct training and performance-based incentives to CFs in boosting farmers' adoption of sustainable land practices (SLM). The design of the evaluation consists of 3 overlaid treatment arms: (1) the revised TV (2) additional women are designated to receive direct SLM training; and (3) additional performance-based incentives for CFs. The various treatment arms were randomly assigned at the village level (150 treatment, 50 control), using a strati ed procedure at the district level.

Farm technology adoption in Kenya: a simultaneous estimation of inorganic fertilizer and improved maize variety adoption decisions,"AbstractThis paper models inorganic fertilizer and improved maize varieties adoption as joint decisions. Controlling for household, plot-level, institutional and other factors, the study found that household adoption decisions on inorganic fertilizer and improved maize varieties were inter-dependent. Other factors found to influence the adoption of the two technologies were farmer characteristics, plot-level factors and market imperfections such as limited access to credit and input markets, and production risks. Thus, easing market imperfections is a pre-requisite for accelerating farm technology adoption among the smallholders. Inter-dependence of farm technologies must also not be ignored in farm technology adoption promotion initiatives.

Dynamics to Equilibrium in Network Games: Individual Behavior and Global Response,"Various social contexts can be depicted as games of strategic interactions on networks, where an individual’s welfare depends on both her and her partners’ actions. Whereas much attention has been devoted to Bayes-Nash equilibria in such games, here we look at strategic interactions from an evolutionary perspective. To this end, we present the results of a numerical simulations program for these games, which allows us to find out whether Nash equilibria are accessible by adaptation of player strategies, and in general to identify the attractors of the evolution. Simulations allow us to go beyond a global characterization of the cooperativeness at equilibrium and probe into individual behavior. We find that when players imitate each other, evolution does not reach Nash equilibria and, worse, leads to very unfavorable states in terms of welfare. On the contrary, when players update their behavior rationally, they self-organize into a rich variety of Nash equilibria, where individual behavior and payoffs are shaped by the nature of the game, the social network’s structure and the players’ position within the network. Our results allow to assess the validity of mean-field approaches we use to describe the dynamics of these games. Interestingly, our dynamically-found equilibria generally do not coincide with (but show qualitatively the same features of) those resulting from theoretical predictions in the context of one-shot games under incomplete information.",2014.0,PLoS ONE,PLoS ONE,"G.

What are the determinants of economic growth in Muslim countries,"Muslim countries are generally considered economically behind the non-Muslim countries, culturally conservative, authoritarian, and misogynistic. Although the Muslim population, as a whole, comprises an enormous economic potential, many Muslims in the world contend with poverty and illiteracy. Furthermore, economic disparity among Muslim nations is widening. This article examines the reasons behind economic inequalities among Muslim countries and explores whether Islam hinders economic growth or not. On the contrary to general belief that Islam hinders economic growth, this study showed that Islam by itself has no effect on economic prosperity in Muslim Countries. Using cross-country regression, this empirical research displayed that the adaptation of technology and scientific innovations, investment to human capital, human development, and economic freedom are significant and necessary for economic growth in Islamic countries.",2014.0,,journal of new results in science,D.

"Social Capital, Network Effects, and Savings in Rural Vietnam",Information failures are a major barrier to formal financial saving in low-income countries. We explore the extent to which social capital in rural Vietnam plays a role in increasing formal savings where knowledge gaps exist. Social capital is defined as information sharing and the elimination of information asymmetries through active participation in the Women's Union. We consider high- and low-quality networks in terms of the quality of information transmitted. We find that membership of high-quality networks leads to higher levels of saving in formal financial institutions and saving for productive investments. Our results support a role for social capital in facilitating savings and suggest that transmitting financial information through the branches of the Women's Union could be effective in increasing formal savings at grassroots level. We also conclude that it is important to ensure that the information disseminated is accurate given that behavioral effects are also found in networks with low-quality information.,2014.0,,Economics of Networks eJournal,"C.

Youth Employment in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Sub-Saharan Africa has just experienced one of the best decades of growth since the 1960s. Between 2000 and 2012, gross domestic product (GDP) grew more than 4.5 percent a year on average, compared to around 2 percent in the prior 20 years (World Bank various years). In 2012, the region's GDP growth was estimated at 4.7 percent- 5.8 percent if South Africa is excluded (World Bank 2013). About one-quarter of countries in the region grew at 7 percent or better, and several African countries are among the fastest growing in the world. Medium-term growth prospects remain strong and should be supported by a rebounding global economy. The challenge of youth employment in Africa may appear daunting, yet Africa's vibrant youth represent an enormous opportunity, particularly now, when populations in much of the world are aging rapidly. Youth not only need jobs, but also create them. Africa's growing labor force can be an asset in the global marketplace. Realizing this brighter vision for Africa's future, however, will require a clearer understanding of how to benefit from this asset. Meeting the youth employment challenge in all its dimensions, demographic, economic, and social, and understanding the forces that created the challenge, can open potential pathways toward a better life for young people and better prospects for the countries where they live. The report examines obstacles faced by households and firms in meeting the youth employment challenge. It focuses primarily on productivity, in agriculture, in nonfarm household enterprises (HEs), and in the modern wage sector, because productivity is the key to higher earnings as well as to more stable, less vulnerable, livelihoods. To respond to the policy makers' dilemma, the report identifies specific areas where government intervention can reduce those obstacles to productivity for households and firms, leading to brighter employment prospects for youth, their parents, and their own children.",2014.0,,,"D.

An Overview and Discussion of Solution Proposals for Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security in Sub-Sahara Africa,"The development of the agricultural sector and the improvement of the food security situation are seen as essential components to sustainable development in Sub-Sahara Africa. However, continuing population growth, impacts of climate change and environmental degradation add to an unprecedented combination of pressures that threaten existing efforts and solutions. This article discusses the relation between the challenges of making agriculture more sustainable and meeting food security needs. Several solutions proposals are discussed and organic farming as one of them is used to develop decision criteria. Due to its involvement of all three dimensions of sustainable development, economic, social and environmental organic farming could be one possible approach to create a more sustainable agricultural system.",2013.0,,Sustainable Agriculture Research,L.

Diversification of Agricultural Production in China: Economic Rationality of Crop Choice under the Producer Subsidy Program,"Dietary habits of Chinese people have transformed drastically over recent years due to rapid economic and income growth, urbanization, and globalization. In response, farmers motivated to enhance their incomes should shift their product mixes to meet these new preferences. If, however, the government prioritizes self-sufficiency for staple foods, farmers' choices will diverge from the income-enhancing outcome. This study thus examines farmer's crop choice rationality in Chinese agriculture via estimation of a stochastic frontier output distance function. The estimated results for allocative efficiencies offer unambiguous evidence that grains excessively are produced relative to vegetables and fruits, a tendency that was particularly noticeable during the time of the Producer Subsidy Program. This program also had a distorting effect on farmers' abilities to make technically efficient choices. These findings lend strong support to the assertion that China's policy goal of grain self-sufficiency is to the detriment of agricultural production in terms of technical and allocative efficiencies.",2013.0,,,J.

Network Proximity and Business Practices in African Manufacturing,"Patterns of correlation in innovation and contractual practices among manufacturing firms in Ethiopia and Sudan are documented. Network data that indicate whether any two firms in the utilized sample do business with each other, buy inputs from a common supplier, or sell output to a common client are used for the analysis. Only limited support is found for the commonly held idea that firms that are more proximate in a network sense are more likely to adopt similar practices. Indeed, for certain practices, adoption decisions appear to be local strategic substitutes: if one firm in a given location uses a certain practice, nearby firms are less likely to do so. These results suggest that the diffusion of technology and new business practices may play a more limited role in spurring growth in Africa's manufacturing sector than is often assumed in the present policy discussion.",2013.0,,Development Economics: Microeconomic Issues in Developing Economies eJournal,"M.

Learning Through Noticing: Theory and Experimental Evidence in Farming,"Existing learning models attribute failures to learn to a lack of data. We model a different barrier. Given the large number of dimensions one could focus on when using a technology, people may fail to learn because they failed to notice important features of the data they possess. We conduct a field experiment with seaweed farmers to test a model of ""learning through noticing."" We find evidence of a failure to notice: On some dimensions, farmers do not even know the value of their own input. Interestingly, trials show that these dimensions are the ones that farmers fail to optimize. Furthermore, consistent with the model, we find that simply having access to the experimental data does not induce learning. Instead, farmers change behavior only when presented with summaries that highlight the overlooked dimensions. We also draw out the implications of learning through noticing for technology adoption, agricultural extension, and the meaning of human capital.",2012.0,,Economics of Innovation eJournal,"Rema Hanna, S.

Strategies of Post-entry Foreign Expansion: Speed-up or Slow-down?,"This study explores the antecedents of the speed of post-entry foreign expansion in a host country. Employing competitive dynamics and organizational learning theories, the study examines the effect of competition, country-specific experience, and general international business experience on the time span between two consecutive entries made by a focal firm in a host country. The study analyses these factors in a dynamic context using a sample of 94 Taiwanese manufacturers in electronic industry with 190 entries between 1991 and 2004. The results show a firm makes faster post-entry expansion when a large number of firms in the same industry sector invest in that host country as a result of competition. However, cumulative host-country and general international business experience result in slower subsequent reinvestment. The findings not only contribute to the literature on competition, organizational learning, and international business, but also enrich our understanding on the evolutionary path of international expansion.",2012.0,,International Business Research,Bau-Jung Chang,10.5539/IBR.V5N8P123,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ddaf955274d4fe100e98bacb4e2e761cc7fc674b,52.0,2.0,0.0,['Economics'],"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Business', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ibr/article/download/18808/12575,,2012-08-01

Adopting a New Religion: The Case of Protestantism in 16th Century Germany,"Using a rich dataset of territories and cities of the Holy Roman Empire in the 16th century, this paper investigates the determinants of adoption and diffusion of Protestantism as a state religion. A territory’s distance to Wittenberg, the city where Martin Luther taught, is a major determinant of adoption. This finding can be explained through a theory of strategic neighbourhood interactions: in an uncertain legal context, introducing the Reformation was a risky enterprise for territorial lords, and had higher prospects of success if powerful neighbouring states committed to the new faith first. The model is tested in a panel dataset featuring the dates of introduction of the Reformation.",2012.0,,Urban Economics & Regional Studies eJournal,Davide Cantoni,10.1111/j.1468-0297.2012.02495.x,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d74bf972b5aaeda634a8423ecd357014cacc0262,49.0,117.0,18.0,"['Political Science', 'Economics']","[{'category': 'Political Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'History', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Political Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,http://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/10230/19925/1/1265.pdf,,2012-05-01

Improving Agricultural Productivity and Market Efficiency in Latin America and the Caribbean : How ICTs Can Make a Difference?,"Agricultural growth rates in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region have been much slower than the rest of the developing world. In the regions of East Asia, South Asia and Middle East and North Africa, the annual growth of agricultural Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1980-2004 exceeded 3 percent, while growth in Sub- Saharan Africa averaged almost 3 percent. This paper attempts to present an overview of the agricultural sector in LAC, discuss its distinctive features, and the potential role of Information and Communication Technology's (ICTs) in improving agricultural productivity and market efficiency in this region. The discussion in this paper will refer to the evidence provided by studies that evaluate the impact of ICTs interventions. While the emphasis will be put on the studies that evaluate interventions in the LAC region, there will also be references to studies in other developing economies whenever these are pertinent to the LAC context. The commercialization of agricultural products has suffered important transformations in recent decades, posing big challenges for farmers in the LAC region. Finally, the adoption of agricultural technologies will also be constrained by insecure land rights. Investing in technologies with long-run returns will not be attractive if farmers are uncertain about their property rights in the future (Jack, 2011). This is certainly an issue in several countries in LAC, where land conflicts, expropriation and de facto ownership are common.",2012.0,,Journal of Reviews on Global Economics,"A.

A general framework for rational learning in social networks,"This paper provides a formal characterization of the process of rational learning in social networks. Agents receive initial private information and select an action out of a choice set under uncertainty in each of infinitely many periods, observing the history of choices of their neighbors. Choices are made based on a common behavioral rule. Conditions under which rational learning leads to global consensus, local indifference and local disagreement are characterized. In the general setting considered, rational learning can lead to pairs of neighbors selecting different actions once learning ends, while not being indifferent among their choices. The effect of the network structure on the degree of information aggregation and speed of convergence is also considered and an answer to the question of optimal information aggregation in networks provided. The results highlight distinguishing features between properties of Bayesian and non-Bayesian learning in social networks.",2011.0,,Theoretical Economics,Manuel Mueller-Frank,10.2139/SSRN.1690924,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fc5539c64d2c0287277a9a08ad5cecd9c4890f0b,41.0,137.0,5.0,['Mathematics'],"[{'category': 'Mathematics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,http://econtheory.org/ojs/index.php/te/article/viewFile/20130001/8126/243,,2011-12-02

Coupled Information Diffusion–Pest Dynamics Models Predict Delayed Benefits of Farmer Cooperation in Pest Management Programs,"Worldwide, the theory and practice of agricultural extension system have been dominated for almost half a century by Rogers' “diffusion of innovation theory”. In particular, the success of integrated pest management (IPM) extension programs depends on the effectiveness of IPM information diffusion from trained farmers to other farmers, an important assumption which underpins funding from development organizations. Here we developed an innovative approach through an agent-based model (ABM) combining social (diffusion theory) and biological (pest population dynamics) models to study the role of cooperation among small-scale farmers to share IPM information for controlling an invasive pest. The model was implemented with field data, including learning processes and control efficiency, from large scale surveys in the Ecuadorian Andes. Our results predict that although cooperation had short-term costs for individual farmers, it paid in the long run as it decreased pest infestation at the community scale. However, the slow learning process placed restrictions on the knowledge that could be generated within farmer communities over time, giving rise to natural lags in IPM diffusion and applications. We further showed that if individuals learn from others about the benefits of early prevention of new pests, then educational effort may have a sustainable long-run impact. Consistent with models of information diffusion theory, our results demonstrate how an integrated approach combining ecological and social systems would help better predict the success of IPM programs. This approach has potential beyond pest management as it could be applied to any resource management program seeking to spread innovations across populations.",2011.0,PLoS Comput.

Poverty and Aspirations Failure,"We develop a theoretical framework to study the psychology of poverty and 'aspirations failure'. In our framework, the rich and the poor share the same preferences - and also a behavioral bias in setting aspirations. Greater downside risks imposed by poverty exacerbates the effects of this behavioral bias: the poor are more susceptible to both an aspirations failure and pessimism about the likelihood of achieving success. Poverty limits the set of people whose life experiences the poor consider relevant for forming their own beliefs and aspirations. Mitigating behavioral poverty traps require policies which go beyond reducing material deprivation.",2011.0,,Wiley-Blackwell: Economic Journal,"P. Dalton, S. Ghosal, A.

"Population, Poverty, and Sustainable Development: A Review of the Evidence","There is a very large but scattered literature debating the economic implications of high fertility. This paper reviews the literature on three themes: (a) Does high fertility affect low-income countries' prospects for economic growth and poverty reduction? (b) Does population growth exacerbate pressure on natural resources? and (c) Are family planning programs effective at lowering fertility, and should they be publicly funded? The literature shows broad consensus that while policy and institutional settings are key in shaping the prospects of economic growth and poverty reduction, the rate of population growth also matters. Recent studies find that low dependency ratios (as fertility declines) create an opportunity for increasing productivity, savings and investment in future growth. They find that lower fertility is associated with better child health and schooling, and better health and greater labor-force participation for women. They also indicate that rapid population growth can constrain economic growth, especially in low-income countries with poor policy environments. Population growth also exacerbates pressure on environmental common property resources. Studies highlight the deep challenges to aligning divergent interests for managing these resources. However, part of the pressure on these resources can be mitigated by reducing the rate of population growth. Although family planning programs are only one policy lever to help reduce fertility, studies find them effective. Such programs might help especially in the Sub-Saharan African region, where high fertility and institutional constraints on economic growth combine to slow rises in living standards.",2011.0,,Sustainability & Economics eJournal,"M.

Spatio-Temporal Patterns for a Generalized Innovation Diffusion Model,"We construct a model of innovation diffusion that incorporates a spatial component into a classical imitation-innovation dynamics first introduced by F. Bass. Relevant for situations where the imitation process explicitly depends on the spatial proximity between agents, the resulting nonlinear field dynamics is exactly solvable. As expected for nonlinear collective dynamics, the imitation mechanism generates spatio-temporal patterns, possessing here the remarkable feature that they can be explicitly and analytically discussed. The simplicity of the model, its intimate connection with the original Bass’ modeling framework and the exact transient solutions offer a rather unique theoretical stylized framework to describe how innovation jointly develops in space and time.",2011.0,,Theoretical Economics Letters,"F.

Social Learning in Social Networks,"This paper analyzes a model of social learning in a social network. Agents decide whether or not to adopt a new technology with unknown payoffs based on their prior beliefs and the experiences of their neighbors in the network. Using a mean-field approximation, we prove that the diffusion process always has at least one stable equilibrium, and we examine the dependence of the set of equilibria on the model parameters and the structure of the network. In particular, we show how first and second order stochastic dominance shifts in the degree distribution of the network impact diffusion. We find that the relationship between equilibrium diffusion levels and network structure depends on the distribution of payoffs to adoption and the distribution of agents' prior beliefs regarding those payoffs, and we derive the precise conditions characterizing those relationships. For example, in contrast to contagion models of diffusion, we find that a first order stochastic dominance shift in the degree distribution can either increase or decrease equilibrium diffusion levels depending on the relationship between agents' prior beliefs and the payoffs to adoption. Surprisingly, adding more links can decrease diffusion even when payoffs from the new technology exceed those of the status quo in expectation.",2010.0,,The B.E.

Timing and Duration of Exposure in Evaluations of Social Programs,"Impact evaluations aim to measure the outcomes that can be attributed to a specific policy or intervention. Although there have been excellent reviews of the different methods that an evaluator can choose in order to estimate impact, there has not been sufficient attention given to questions related to timing: How long after a program has begun should one wait before evaluating it? How long should treatment groups be exposed to a program before they can be expected to benefit from it? Are there important time patterns in a program's impact? Many impact evaluations assume that interventions occur at specified launch dates and produce equal and constant changes in conditions among eligible beneficiary groups; but there are many reasons why this generally is not the case. This paper examines the evaluation issues related to timing and discusses the sources of variation in the duration of exposure within programs and their implications for impact estimates. It reviews the evidence from careful evaluations of programs (with a focus on developing countries) on the ways that duration affects impacts.",2008.0,,Political Economy: Government Expenditures & Related Policies eJournal,"E.

Changing Households' Investments and Aspirations Through Social Interactions: Evidence from a Randomized Transfer Program,"This brief summarizes the results of a gender impact evaluation study, entitled Changing households' investment and aspirations through social interactions : evidence from a randomized transfer program, conducted between November 2005 and December 2006 in Nicaragua. The study observed the impact of social interactions in determining aspirations in the context of a program aimed at increasing households' investments on the household head. Participants who were in close proximity to leaders who received the largest program substantially increased the on human capital investment, income diversification, and attitudes towards the future. Participants increased aspirations were driven by increased communication and motivation by female leaders. Having an additional leader with a productive investment package increases school attendance by about 2.5 percent, reduces absences by about 0.85 days per month, increases income from non-agricultural activities by about 3.3 dollar and increases the value of the animal stock by about 12 dollar.

Análisis de Redes Sociales aplicado al estudio de los procesos de innovación agrícola,"Since the 1970’s, studies on adoption of agricultural innovations have been dominated by a perspective according to which adoption is an individual decision, focused on the utilities to be perceived by the farmer. In recent years there is a growing interest for understanding the role of social interaction in these processes. Social capital and social learning are concepts that have gradually received attention among scholars. But very few agricultural innovation studies have taken advantage of Social Network Analysis. Based on a data set on interactions among farmers and other relevant actors for innovation processes in 12 micro regions of Bolivia, we analyzed the effects of those interactions on the intensity of adoption of diverse innovations, considering the tools provided by UCINET and NetDraw software packages.",2008.0,,REDES: Revista Hispana para el Análisis de Redes Sociales,"M.

Transfer of Knowledge on Agroforestry Management Practices: the Structure of Farmer Advice Networks,"Access to knowledge on farm management practices is essential for the maintenance of productive agroforestry systems. Farmers who lack the means to acquire farming knowledge from formal sources often rely on information within their informal social networks. However, little research has explored the explicit structure of farmer communication patterns. We examined advice network structures by using farmer attributes, i.e., kin relationships, community involvement, and imitation, to characterize structural positions and investigated the consequences of such structure on farming practices in cocoa agroforestry systems in Ghana, West Africa. Furthermore, we used a multicommunity approach; we constructed networks for four communities to increase replication and enhance the generality of our conclusions. A high density of advice ties occurred among a small group of farmers, indicating a core- periphery structure. Settler farmers composed 73% of core position members, suggesting that social proximity did not control the formation of informal advice structures. Because core farmers were highly participative in community activities, the promotion of community involvement may facilitate the movement of knowledge and social exchange to strengthen informal networks. Farmers in both core and peripheral structural positions indicated that they observed fellow farmers and subsequently adopted their practices. Of highly sought farmers, 84% used external information, predominately from government institutions, thus functioning as bridging links between formal and informal networks. Both external and farmer-derived sources of knowledge of agroforestry practices were transferred through informal advice networks, providing available information throughout the farming community, as well as a foundation for community-based adaptive management.",2007.0,,Ecology and Society,"M.

"Gender Equality, Poverty and Economic Growth","This paper reviews empirical findings from economic analyses of the role of gender equality and women's empowerment in reducing poverty and stimulating growth. Going beyond the large literature documenting the impact of female education on a range of development outcomes, the paper presents evidence on the impact of women's access to markets (labor, land, and credit) and women's decision-making power within households on poverty reduction and productivity at the individual and household level. The paper also summarizes evidence from studies examining the relationship between gender equality and poverty reduction and growth at the macro level. Although micro level effects of gender equality on individual productivity and human development outcomes have been well documented and have important ramifications for aggregate economic performance, establishing an empirical relationship between gender equality and poverty reduction and growth at the macro level has proven to be more challenging. The paper concludes by identifying priority areas for future research.",2007.0,,Labor: Demographics & Economics of the Family,"N. Sinha, D. Raju, A.

Mobile Phones and Economic Development: Evidence from the Fishing Industry in India,"There is considerable speculation about the correlation between investments in telecommunications and economic development. Mobile phones, by virtue of their role as carriers and conduits of information, ought to lessen the information asymmetries in markets, thereby making rural and undeveloped markets more efficient. This research tests this assumption using a case-study from India, where the fishing community in the south-western state of Kerala has adopted mobile phones in large numbers. We find that with the wide-spread use of mobile phones, markets become more efficient as risk and uncertainty are reduced; there is greater market integration; there are gains in productivity and in the Marshallian surplus (sum of consumer and producer surplus); and price dispersion and price fluctuations are reduced. The potential efficiencies are, however, subject to easy access to capital, without which the market remains less efficient than it could be. Finally, the quality of life of the fishermen improves as they feel less isolated, and less at risk in times of emergencies",2006.0,International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies and Development,2006 International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies and Development,Reuben Abraham,10.1109/ICTD.2006.301837,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3216c4e7ae991ab00863f813c31be8ff662757de,45.0,366.0,28.0,"['Economics', 'Computer Science']","[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Computer Science', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://doi.org/10.1162/itid.2007.4.1.5,"['JournalArticle', 'Conference']",2006-05-25

"Trade Costs, Export Development, and Poverty in Rwanda","For Rwanda, one of the poorest countries in the world, trade offers the most effective route for substantial poverty reduction. But the poor in Rwanda, most of whom are subsistence farmers in rural areas, are currently disconnected from markets and commercial activities by extremely high transport costs and by severe constraints on their ability to shift out of subsistence farming. The constraints include lack of access to credit and lack of access to information on the skills and techniques required to produce commercial crops. The paper is based on information from the household survey and a recent diagnostic study of constraints to trade in Rwanda. It provides a number of indicative simulations that show the potential for substantial reductions in poverty from initiatives that reduce trade costs, enhance the quality of exportable goods, and facilitate movement out of subsistence into commercial activities.",2005.0,,New Institutional Economics,"N.

Reassessing Conditional Cash Transfer Programs,"During the past decade, the use of conditional cash transfer programs to increase investment in human capital has generated considerable excitement in both research and policy forums. This article surveys the existing literature, which suggests that most conditional cash transfer programs are used for essentially one of two purposes: restoring efficiency when externalities exist or improving equity by targeting resources to poor households. The programs often meet their stated objectives, but in some instances there is tension between the efficiency and equity objectives. The overall impact of a program depends on the gains and losses associated with each objective.",2005.0,,World Bank Research Observer,"Jishnu Das, Quy-Toan Do, B.

Growth Theory Through the Lens of Development Economics,"Growth theory has traditionally assumed the existence of an aggregate production function, whose existence and properties are closely tied to the assumption of optimal resource allocation within each economy. We show extensive evidence, culled from the micro-development literature, demonstrating that the assumption of optimal resource allocation fails radically. The key fact is the enormous heterogeneity of rates of return to the same factor within a single economy, a heterogeneity that dwarfs the cross-country heterogeneity in the economy-wide average return. Prima facie, we argue, this evidence poses problems for old and new growth theories alike. We then review the literature on various causes of this misallocation. We go on to calibrate a simple model which explicitly introduces the possibility of misallocation into an otherwise standard growth model. We show that, in order to match the data, it is enough to have misallocated factors: there also needs to be important fixed costs in production. We conclude by outlining the contour of a possible non-aggregate growth theory, and review the existing attempts to take such a model to the data.",2004.0,,Development Economics,"A. Banerjee, E.

The Power of Information: Evidence from a Newspaper Campaign to Reduce Capture,"The authors exploit an unusual policy experiment to evaluate the effects of increased public access to information as a tool to reduce capture and corruption of public funds. In the late 1990s, the Ugandan government initiated a newspaper campaign to boost schools' and parents' ability to monitor local officials' handling of a large school-grant program. The results were striking: capture was reduced from 80 percent in 1995 to less than 20 percent in 2001. The authors use distance to the nearest newspaper outlet as an instrument for exposure to the campaign. Proximity to a newspaper outlet is positively correlated with the head teachers' knowledge about rules governing the grant program and the timing of releases of funds from the center, but uncorrelated with test scores of general ability. A strong (reduced-form) relationship exists between proximity to a newspaper outlet and reduction in capture of school funds since the newspaper campaign started. This pattern contrasts sharply with the outcomes in the five-year period prior to the campaign. Instrumenting for head teachers' knowledge about the grant program, the authors find that public access to information is a powerful deterrent to capture at the local level.",2004.0,,,"R.

Externalities in Rural Development: Evidence for China,"The author tests for external effects of local economic activity on consumption and income growth at the farm-household level using panel data from four provinces of post-reform rural China. The tests allow for non-stationary fixed effects in the consumption growth process. Evidence is found of geographic externalities, stemming from spillover effects of the level and composition of local economic activity and private returns to local human and physical infrastructure endowments. The results suggest an explanation for rural underdevelopment arising from under-investment in certain externality-generating activities, of which agricultural development emerges as the most important.",2002.0,,Institutional & Transition Economics eJournal,M.

Attrition in Longitudinal Household Survey Data: Some Tests for Three Developing-Country Samples,"For capturing dynamic demographic relationships, longitudinal household data can have considerable advantages over more widely used cross-sectional data. But because the collection of longitudinal data may be difficult and expensive, analysts must assess the magnitudes of the problems, specific to longitudinal, but not to cross-sectional data. One problem that concerns many analysts is that sample attrition may make the interpretation of estimates problematic. Such attrition may be especially severe where there is considerable migration between rural, and urban areas. And attrition is likely to be selective on such characteristics as schooling, so high attrition is likely to bias estimates. The authors consider the extent, and implications of attrition for three longitudinal household surveys from Bolivia, Kenya, and South Africa that report very high annual attrition rates between survey rounds. Their estimates indicate that: 1) the means for a number of critical outcome, and family background variables differ significantly between those who are lost to follow-up, and those who are re-interviewed. 2) A number of family background variables are significant predictors of attrition. 3) Nevertheless, the coefficient estimates for standard family background variables in regressions, and probit equations for the majority of outcome variables in all three data sets, are not significantly affected by attrition. So attrition is apparently not a general problem for obtaining consistent estimates of the coefficients of interest for most of these outcomes. These results, which are very similar to those for industrial countries, suggest that multivariate estimates of behavioral relations may not be biased because of attrition. This wold support the collection of longitudinal data.",1999.0,,,"H. Alderman, J. Behrman, H. Kohler, J. Maluccio, S.

Social Benefits of Education,"The majority of research on the outcomes of education has focused on the effect of educational attainment on individuals' wages and on the level of skill in the economy as a whole. In this article, however, Nevzer Stacey argues that examining the social benefits of education beyond its economic impact would provide a more comprehensive informational basis for developing national educational policies. She reviews the literature that examines the impact of educational attainment on four areas of potential intervention: health; family structure, fertility, and child care; the environment; and crime. Although these studies report some statistics on education, virtually none uses measures of learning or inputs related to the learning process to estimate the effect of education. Stacey concludes that a more systematic analysis is needed to improve our under-standing of the full effect of education on society in order to determine appropriate public policy.",1998.0,,The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,N.

Gender Issues and Employment in Asia,"A major means of engaging women more in development processes is increasingly productive employment. This paper adds perspective on gender issues and employment in Asian developing countries. First, employment experiences of Asian women, both across countries and over time, are characterized with aggregate data. There are some strong associations between development and many employment variables, though strikingly not for female / male wages. Second, some micro evidence on selected dimensions of Asian employment and gender issues is summarized: increasing relative female to male returns to schooling in labor markets at higher schooling levels, information problems and possible statistical discrimination against females in rural labor markets, and the limited impact of equal opportunity employment efforts. Finally, some employment and gender issues are summarized relating to women’s welfare and employment, the nature of discrimination in labor markets, efficiency reasons for policy interventions, the possible key role of information, and the role of education.",1995.0,Asian Development Review,Asian Development Review,"J.

Gradual learning from incremental actions,"We introduce a collective experimentation problem where a continuum of agents choose the timing of irreversible actions under uncertainty and where public feedback from the actions arrives gradually over time. The leading application is the adoption of new technologies. The socially optimal expansion path entails an informational trade‐off where acting today speeds up learning but postponing capitalizes on the option value of waiting. We contrast the social optimum to the decentralized equilibrium where agents ignore the social value of information they generate. We show that the equilibrium can be obtained by assuming that agents ignore the future actions of other agents, which lets us recast the complicated two‐dimensional problem as a series of one‐dimensional problems.",2025.0,Theoretical Economics,Theoretical Economics,"Tuomas Laiho, P.

The role of farmer networks in supporting adaptive capacity: Opening the door for innovation and transformation in the Northeastern United States,"This article explores the role of farmer networks in building the adaptive capacity of small and diversified farmers in the Northeastern United States. Previous research suggests that farmers’ networks are the backbone of practical agricultural knowledge systems in the United States, serving as a critical venue where growers exchange and negotiate new ideas. Drawing upon empirical evidence from a regional survey on climate resilience and a series of focus groups conducted in collaboration with 9 farmer organizations from Pennsylvania to Eastern Canadian provinces, this article examines how the emergence of new ideas and agroecological innovations are influenced by geography, network affiliation, and perceived agency. First, we use regression analysis to identify factors that influence the use of no-till on diversified vegetable and berry farms, which is an emerging innovation in this community. Our analysis shows that geography may not be a significant driver of adoption among the population we sampled, which contrasts with previous research on explanatory factors, yet affiliation with certain farmer networks was significant in predicting the use or intended use of the practice. This quantitative analysis is complemented by qualitative data from a series of focus groups in which farmers identify the characteristics of certain networks which support them in addressing new challenges. Farmers identified that networks support them in learning about new ideas, accessing resources, and engaging in creative problem-solving, through facilitation of spaces for exchange with peers and experts and being responsive to their emerging needs.",2023.0,Elem Sci Anth,Elem Sci Anth,"Alissa White, J.

Toward the next angiosperm revolution: Agroecological food production as a driver for biological diversity,"Flowering plants once drove a global shift in insect–plant–animal relationships and supported an increase in biodiversity, energy flux, and productivity throughout terrestrial ecosystems. We argue here that angiosperms could once again contribute to biodiversity within landscapes, if agroecosystems, and the plants within them, can be managed for multifunctional benefits. The potential for farmland to support biological diversity is understood and well-argued in the literature. We take this long-standing conversation and frame it within a longer evolutionary context, bringing attention to how modification in 2 key areas of our current food production system could support this goal. First, a move toward crop and grazing landscapes that more closely align with regional food webs can lead to observable improvements in community wildlife abundance. Second, we can re-expand the genetic base of our food, fodder, and cover crops, in particular by using crop wild relatives, through the use of wide crosses, genome-assisted selection, and participatory breeding. Agriculture as it is now widely practiced utilizes a narrow sliver of total angiosperm species diversity and within-species genetic diversity on a large amount of land. Change to this status quo requires coordination across tightly interlinked policy areas. It will also require social change. Farmers should be supported to transition through nudges throughout their social network. This necessitates a significant shift in our collective culture to value growing and consuming the flowering crops that can trigger an angiosperm revolution of the Anthropocene.",2023.0,Elem Sci Anth,Elem Sci Anth,"Sara Delaney, Eric J.

"Does External Shock Influence Farmer’s Adoption of Modern Irrigation Technology?—A Case of Gansu Province, China","Due to the severe irrigational water scarcity and ever-growing contamination of existing water resources, the potential of improved and innovative irrigation technology has emerged. The risk-taking network may play an essential role in the adoption of modern irrigation technology (MIT). The main goals of the current study were to find the impacts of external shocks on MIT adoption by farmers. For doing so, the study analyzed the mediating effect of economic vulnerability (EV) and the moderating effect of the risk-taking network on farmer’s adaptation of MIT. Economic vulnerability of farmers refers to risks caused by external shocks to the farming system which may affect the farmer’s adoption of MIT. The empirical set-up of the study consists of micro survey data of 509 farmers from the Gansu Province of China. The results show that the external shock has a significant negative impact on adapting MIT by rural farmers. At the same time, EV plays an intermediary effect in increasing the impact of external irrigation on the adaptation of MIT. The intermediary to total effect is 36.57%. The risk-taking network has a moderate effect on the relationship between external shocks, affecting farmers to adopt MIT, while external shocks also increase EV which affects farmers’ adopting MIT. Thus, it can be said that the risk-taking network regulates the direct path of external shocks affecting farmers’ choice to adapt to MIT, and external shocks also affect farmer’s MIT adaptation. The public and private partnerships should be strengthened to facilitate risk minimization. Government should provide subsidies, and financial organizations should also formulate more accessible loans and risk-sharing facilities. The government should expand the support for formal and informal risk-taking network. They should also extend their support for formal and informal risk-taking networks to improve the risk response-ability of vulnerable farmers. The concerned authorities should attach smallholder farmers’ socio-economic structure and reform the existing policies according to their demands. The governmental authorities should also endorse the risk-sharing function of informal institutions.",2021.0,Land,Land,"Yongfeng Tan, Apurbo Sarkar, A. Rahman, L.

Adoption Lag Minimization for Increasing Rice Yield,"Sustainable adoption of promising technology leads to increase yield and productivity of rice significantly. Yield gap reduction through minimization of adoption cycle of rice technologies is essential to increase food security of Bangladesh. Adoption of promising rice variety required 16±3 years to reach its adoption peak at farm level following the existing dissemination protocol. The specific objective is to find out the ways and means to curtail adoption lag of variety, management practices and rice based technologies for sustainable food security of Bangladesh. The study is accomplished accordingly by reviewing previous works completed on technology adoption; calculation and estimation of future seed demand and supply. Our findings reveal that the average yield gap between actual farm yield and potential farm yield is 20.7%. Seed retention and motivated farmers estimated from the frontline demonstrations of BRRI were 18 and 20%, respectively. Sufficient amounts (128 kg/variety) of breeder seed need to be produced by the concerned research organizations concurrently the variety release process. The seed will be used to execute action plan by setting up 64 adaptive trials (AT) in 64 districts to select location specific suitable variety(s) for rapid dissemination. In the 2nd and 3rd years, 256 kg quality seeds per variety will be required to conduct 128 AT/SPDP in 64 districts. The seed of farmers’ chosen variety(s) will be collected, stored, and marketed by the local seed producer or farmers group; and they will provide this information to the extension organization and BRRI. At least 10 to 20% seed selling information will be checked by the concerned scientist of BRRI every year and total seed selling data will be calibrated based on the checked data. Similarly, the next two years’ trial data will be collected from conducted trials and associated seed producer/dealer/farmers’ club/groups. Then, the concerned research institute will be able to provide a projection of diffusion rate and demand of newly released variety(s) compiling three years data. Based on the authentic reports, the concerned organizations will conduct block, frontline and follow-up demonstrations in collaboration with all the stakeholders. Action plan of research and extension; large scale frontline demonstration of the selected variety(s) with more stakeholders followed by field day, training, and workshop would be the key drivers for effective and sustainable dissemination of technology lead to reduce adoption lag effectively. Combined initiatives and integrated approaches need to be taken nationally to execute the adoption lag minimization plans and model for rapid dissemination of promising technology to doubling the rice productivity. Therefore, popularization and adoption of new technology would be possible within five to seven years instead of 16±3 years.

Seed Selection Strategies for Information Diffusion in Social Networks: An Agent-Based Model Applied to Rural Zambia,"The successful adoptionof innovationsdependson theprovisionof adequate information to farmers. In rural areas of developing countries, farmers usually rely on their social networks as an information source. Hence, policy-makers and program-implementers can benefit from social di usion processes to e ectively disseminate information. This study aims to identify the set of farmers who initially obtain information (‘seeds’) that optimises di usion through the network. It systematically evaluates di erent criteria for seed selection, number of seeds, and their interaction e ects. An empirical Agent-Based Model adjusted to a case study in rural Zambia was applied to predict di usion outcomes for varying seed sets ex ante. Simulations revealed that informing farmers with the most connections leads to highest di usion speed and reach. Also targeting village heads and farmers with high betweenness centrality, who function as bridges connecting di erent parts of the network, enhances di usion. An increased number of seeds improves reach, but the marginal e ects of additional seeds decline. Interdependencies between seed set size and selection criteria highlight the importance of considering both seed selection criteria and seed set size for optimising seeding strategies to enhance information di usion.",2020.0,Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation,J.

The paper investigates the similarities and differences between the adoption of technology from OECD and non-OECD countries. The empirical finding shows that the skills of labor force and openness to trade are the most robust determinants of technology adoption at the provincial level. Furthermore, provinces with higher levels of R&D expenditure adopt more technology from OECD countries than do other provinces.",2020.0,,,"Hoai Nam Nguyen, Q.

THE USE AND PERCEIVED IMPACT OF MOBILE COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (MCT) IN BOTSWANA COMMERCIAL FARMING,"There has been rapid development of mobile communication technology (MCT) in the last decade with Botswana having a tele density of 168 %, hence the need to find out if MCT is effectively used in agriculture. A sample of 36 commercial farmers answered a questionnaire. All commercial farmers in the study own at least one form of MCT device, the most common being mobile phone. In spite of ownership of such devices, commercial farmers do not adequately use MCT in their farm work as on average 53 % said they have used it in one form or another. The perceived impact of MCT in commercial farming is also not satisfactory as on average 50% of the farmers in the sample answered in the negative. The unsatisfactory use of MCT by farmers can be mitigated by having discussions with farmers and showing them the benefits of using MCT in their farm work.",2017.0,,,"T.

Spatio-temporal dynamics of land use changes in response to external pressures in Oman: Greenhouse cropping as an example,"Further from the northern coast of Oman new farm developments were more frequent than closer to the coast; they were also larger. The density of farms was highest close to Muscat although the distance enclosing 50% of farms had shifted away from Muscat during the study period. The dominance of Muscat is likely to be related to access to markets and infrastructure development. The increase in groundwater salinity was also highest close to Muscat and may be responsible for the shift in greenhouse density. Salinization of groundwater is severe close to the coast and was responsible for the reduced density of greenhouses near the coast. Land abandonment was highest close to Muscat and to the coast, reflecting changes in groundwater salinity and urbanization pressure. Less evidence was available for a direct shift from farmland to urban land use. Recent urban developments were largely located in areas already abandoned by agriculture. The paper also discusses likely future trends in land use change given that Oman’s population is increasing at over 2% annually and demand for urban land is increasing. The identification of a “salinity corridor” within which much of the future land use change may occur is discussed.",2016.0,,Journal of Agricultural and Marine Sciences,"M. Deadman, A.

Social Learning through Social Networks and Technological Appropriation: The Role of Peer Effects in the Adoption and Use of the Internet in Cameroonian Tontines,"This article attempts to verify whether tontines constitute a social learning platform for the appropriation of technology that underlies patterns of adoption and use of the Internet in sub-Saharan Africa. It uses for this purpose a survey of 2650 households in the cities of Douala, Buea and Limbe and employs initially two zero-inflated count data models to highlight the Intensity of the practice of tontines and after, simple probit models to detect the presence of favorable peer effects in the association tontines on the likelihood of adoption and use of the Internet in Cameroonian households. The results show that, while in ROSCA-type tontines social learning is uncertain because of neutral peer effects, in association tontines within socio-professional groups peer effects are positive and reinforce the process of adoption. These results confirm the studies on dissocializing Internet carried in United States and Europe at the beginning of the dynamics of its diffusion. However and more important, the results presented here show that peer effects play positively on social learning and technology appropriation that underlie the adoption and use of the Internet not in tontine of ROSCA-type, but in the tontine envisaged in professional groups according to their propensity to use modern values for jobs.",2013.0,,,G.

Soil Conservation on Sloping Land: Technical Options and Adoption Constraints,"This chapter briefly summarizes the causes and consequences of soil erosion, before presenting examples of effective soil conservation technologies (SCT), such as contour-based cropping, cover crops, mulching and geo-textiles, and based on case studies from northern Thailand and northern Vietnam. Depending on site conditions, a soil erosion reduction of 30–60 % in the first year after establishment and up to 72–98 % by the third year was observed in these studies when compared to local farmers’ practices. In north-east Thailand, maize grain yields increased from 1.5 and 3.2 Mg ha−1, to 3.8 and 5.5 Mg ha−1 under minimum tillage und relay cropping. The study in north-western Vietnam revealed that although the majority of farmers were aware of soil erosion mitigation methods, adoption rates of the promoted soil conservation technologies remained low. These technologies compete for land and labor resources with the main cropping activities, in particular highly profitable commercial maize cultivation, incurring high opportunity costs. Based on these case studies, we conclude that innovative approaches to soil conservation require a change in land use systems, not just the adoption of conventional SCT in the existing systems. The integration of plant and animal production in the uplands should be promoted that allows farmers to benefit from urban-based economic growth on the one hand, such as through the exploitation of niche markets for high-value meat, while being environmentally sustainable on the other. The improved integration of animal husbandry with plant production systems could make feed producing soil conservation options more attractive to farmers, which could be further stimulated by introducing payment for environmental services (PES) schemes.",2013.0,,,"T.

Attrition in longitudinal household survey data,"Longitudinal household data can have considerable advantages over much more widely used cross-sectional data. The collection of longitudinal data, however, may be difficult and expensive. One problem that has concerned many analysts is that sample attrition may make the interpretation of estimates problematic. Such attrition may be particularly severe in areas where there is considerable mobility because of migration between rural and urban areas. Many analysts share the intuition that attrition is likely to be selective on characteristics such as schooling and that high attrition is likely to bias estimates made from longitudinal data. This paper considers the extent of and implications of attrition for three longitudinal household surveys from Bolivia, Kenya, and South Africa that report very high per-year attrition rates between survey rounds. Our estimates indicate that (1) the means for a number of critical outcome and family background variables differ significantly between attritors and nonattritors; (2) a number of family background variables are significant predictors of attrition; but (3) nevertheless, the coefficient estimates for “standard” family background variables in regressions and probit equations for the majority of the outcome variables considered in all three data sets are not affected significantly by attrition. Therefore, attrition apparently is not a general problem for obtaining consistent estimates of the coefficients of interest for most of these outcomes. These results, which are very similar to results for developed economies, suggest that for these outcome variables—despite suggestions of systematic attrition from univariate comparisons between attritors and nonattritors, multivariate estimates of behavioral relations of interest may not be biased due to attrition.",2000.0,,,"H.
