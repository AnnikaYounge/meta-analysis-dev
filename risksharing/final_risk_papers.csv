Social network structure and the radius of risk sharing,"
 Informal risk sharing, an important coping strategy, is mediated by social networks. Does risk sharing extend beyond immediate connections? If so, what is its radius? I examine the radius of risk sharing as a function of network structure. To do so, I employ community detection—a tool imported from network science—and dyadic regression. I find evidence the radius of risk sharing extends beyond direct connections. Using data from a behavioral experiment in Colombia, I find that detected community co-membership and distance-2 connections (i.e., friends of friends) explain co-membership in experimental risk sharing groups. Using data from a village census in Tanzania, I find that distance-2 and 3 connections explain risk sharing transfers, but detected community co-membership does not. I address a crucial issue of network sampling in the Colombia illustration using simulation methods, finding my preferred specification is robust to this concern. These methods may benefit those who seek to understand the quality of risk sharing when risk sharing groups are loosely defined and illegible to outsiders.",2025.0,Social Network Analysis and Mining,Social Network Analysis and Mining,Daniel S.

The poverty prevention effects of health insurance: evidence from China's basic medical insurance program,"Background China's Basic Medical Insurance (BMI) system is designed to alleviate illness-induced poverty. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of BMI in pre-venting households from falling into poverty, uncover its underlying mechanisms, and propose a preferential subsidy policy to address existing inequities. Methods Panel data from the 2010–2018 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) were used. We employed Probit and Heckman models to assess how BMI enrollment influences poverty likelihood, focusing on rural–urban differences, total healthcare expenditures, and out-of-pocket (OOP) spending. We also proposed a tiered, progressively subsidized policy—“income segmentation with progressive reimbursement”—as a potential strategy to bolster poverty prevention among low-income households. Results Our findings indicate that BMI enrollment significantly reduces the probability of house-holds becoming poor, with more pronounced effects in rural areas than in urban ones. Following enrollment, total healthcare expenditures rise substantially and health outcomes improve, yet OOP expenses do not show a corresponding decline and can even increase for urban residents. Moreover, higher-income groups benefit more from BMI, whereas low-income families face financial constraints that limit their ability to fully utilize these benefits. Conclusions Despite BMI's success in improving health out-comes, moral hazard remains a concern, particularly in urban settings. A tiered, progressively subsidized approach can more effectively support low-income households, lowering their risk of falling back into poverty due to illness. These results underscore the importance of refining insurance policies to ensure that vulnerable populations can fully benefit from healthcare coverage.",2025.0,Frontiers in Public Health,Frontiers in Public Health,"Xinyue Yuan, Xujin Yang, Xianhua Zhou",10.3389/fpubh.2025.1576146,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c43f900ef7c6c72ddadea04f3bd4b1ae58da9431,34.0,0.0,0.0,['Medicine'],"[{'category': 'Medicine', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Medicine', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",False,,['JournalArticle'],2025-04-24,True,True
Analysis of the role of medical insurance in the “Health shocks-consumption upgrading” model: evidence from China,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant health shocks worldwide, along with a certain burden on healthcare systems. China's healthcare security system has been continuously improved and has essentially achieved universal coverage. Moreover, the health impact of COVID-19 on the Chinese population is diminishing, and the trend of consumption upgrading is becoming more pronounced. Methods Based on the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model, this study constructs a theoretical model of “health shocks-consumption upgrading” to deduce the impact of health shocks on consumption upgrading. We examine the results of the theoretical model using provincial panel data from China spanning from 2002 to 2019 and employing the system GMM estimation method. Furthermore, based on a moderation effect model, we explore the mechanism of basic medical insurance systems in this model. Results The theoretical model deduces that health shocks lead to a decline in consumption upgrading, which is empirically confirmed. Additionally, the results of moderation effect analysis demonstrate that basic medical insurance systems play a positive moderating role in the “health shocks-consumption upgrading” model. Among the basic medical insurance systems, the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) primarily acts as a positive moderator. Conclusion Health shocks lead to consumption downgrading, while basic medical insurance systems help to diversify medical risks, alleviate health shocks, reduce precautionary savings, and thereby promote consumption upgrading.",2025.0,Health Economics Review,Health Economics Review,"Qi Hu, Ennan Wang, Minglai Zhu",10.1186/s13561-025-00635-6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/59bc24339637449b4c71f6ab564ac6a337156709,44.0,0.0,0.0,['Medicine'],"[{'category': 'Medicine', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Medicine', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",False,,['JournalArticle'],2025-04-24,True,True
Network Size and Temporary Migration,"In this study, we explore the impact of network size on temporary migration, using data from the Indian Human Development Survey 2011–12. Network size indicates the availability of informal risk‐sharing for rural households, with temporary migration acting as another self‐insurance method. We demonstrate that the effect of network size on migration is contingent upon the network's endowment, particularly emphasizing the role of credit constraints in low‐endowed networks. The findings reveal that larger network sizes reduce temporary migration in high‐endowed upper‐caste networks but increase in less‐endowed lower‐caste networks. This association is supported using historical caste population data from the 1961 census and regions dominated by non‐migrants. We further ascertain that enhanced network size alleviates credit constraints in lower‐endowed networks, driven by the network's income and influenced by exogenous rainfall shocks.",2025.0,Review of Development Economics,Review of Development Economics,"Vikram Bahure, Pritam Saha",10.1111/rode.13233,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5023b975d849b5639f402c32034af55c6c3432a4,16.0,0.0,0.0,,"[{'category': 'Sociology', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",False,,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",2025-04-14,True,True
Health shock and indebtedness: Does having access to health insurance reduce the reliance on borrowing as a shock coping strategy?,"Households in developing countries are often impaired in their economic opportunities by major health shocks. In this article, we first investigate the impact of a health shock on rural household consumption and explore the mechanisms how the health shock brings a household into indebtedness. We then examine the role of health insurance in reducing the reliance on borrowing as a shock coping strategy. Our estimations show that while rural households are able to insure non‐health‐related consumption, a health shock pushes them into severe indebtedness by increasing informal borrowing to smooth consumption. Promotion of health insurance is recommended as it helps to protect households from falling into severe indebtedness when a health shock strikes.",2025.0,Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy,Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy,"Linh D.

On the effectiveness of insurance mechanisms for older individuals in China,"Does consumption smoothing among older individuals over time and across households indicate the efficiency of overall insurance mechanisms against health shocks? And what is the extent of suboptimality in various market and non-market insurance arrangements? To address these questions, we utilize panel data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) spanning 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018 to evaluate the effectiveness of both institutional and informal insurance mechanisms for older individuals in China. While conventional tests generally support consumption smoothing for essential items across time and individuals in response to adverse health shocks, our findings indicate that the welfare costs associated with these shocks are not insignificant, particularly in rural areas. These results underscore the need for strengthened long-term care, pension systems, and other social safety nets, which could enhance welfare even when consumption appears resilient to shocks.",2024.0,Japanese Economic Review,The Japanese Economic Review,"Jingyi Fang, Yasuyuki Sawada",10.1007/s42973-024-00181-6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2c4f846549375d2ccf9b5bd3879c9b620e0ba214,35.0,0.0,0.0,,"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42973-024-00181-6,['JournalArticle'],2024-11-28,True,True
Self‐control or social control? Peer effects on temptation consumption,"This paper examines peer effects on self‐control problems. I construct a theoretical model to describe how peer networks influence consumption behaviors through social norms. Using monthly survey data conducted in 16 Thai villages from 1999 through 2004, I find that peer's temptation consumption significantly impacts individuals' temptation consumption such as alcohol, tobacco, and gambling. A one baht (around $0.025 U.S. dollars) increase in peer's temptation consumption leads to a 1.5 times increase in one's own temptation consumption. With detailed household‐level social network information defined by actual transactions, this paper identifies peer effects using a friend of a friend (excluded network) as the instrument. The panel nature of this instrument overcomes various common identification challenges, such as reflection, correlated effects, and common unobservable shocks, in the literature. My findings suggest that these peer effects are driven primarily by social norms, rather than risk sharing.",2024.0,Southern Economic Journal,Southern Economic Journal,Yating Chuang,10.1002/soej.12697,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f064939da51b3a8dda6c26ccbc7d103e8e87c453,80.0,1.0,0.0,['Economics'],"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",False,,"['JournalArticle', 'Review']",2024-06-12,True,True
Does inequality impede risk management? Evidence from a lab experiment in Ghana,"Low income households in agrarian developing economies face considerable livelihood risks, which have negative impacts on welfare. A growing literature focuses on internal constraints on development, which can negatively affect saving and investment behavior. Here I propose that internal constraints may also hinder risk management. Specifically, I present a theoretical model that explores how fairness preferences may create an internal constraint on risk sharing, particularly in a context of wealth inequality, and thereby also affect demand for formal insurance. To test this theory, I utilize a lab experiment, conducted in Ghana, to investigate the impact of wealth inequality on utilization of risk‐management tools, interpersonal risk sharing and formal insurance, and explore how fairness preferences may mediate this effect. I find that inequality reduces risk sharing and increases demand for insurance. Moreover, I find suggestive evidence that fairness preferences create an internal constraint on risk sharing under inequality.",2024.0,Journal of Risk and Insurance,Journal of Risk and Insurance,Richard A.

"Adverse shocks, vulnerability, and coping by rural households in Vietnam","Vulnerability to poverty derives from adverse shocks and adaptive capacity. To alleviate poverty, policy‐makers must understand sources of vulnerability, household coping strategies, and the effectiveness of current insurance. Vietnam is an important case due to the many hazards that rural households face and the inadequacy of social safety nets.This article investigates the role of adverse shocks on vulnerability, coping strategies, and recovery of households in rural Vietnam.Using a unique panel data set from Vietnam Access to Resources Household Surveys (VARHSs) during 2008–2016, I first estimate and deconstruct sources of vulnerability. To examine household behaviour when coping with adverse shocks, I use a multivariate probit model; to investigate whether coping strategies help households recover from shocks, I use a multinominal probit model. Finally, I evaluate the effectiveness of existing risk‐management mechanisms.The average rural household in Vietnam experiences a 72% decrease in utility due to shocks. Idiosyncratic shocks contribute 32% of the loss. Rural households are highly dependent on informal coping, such as reducing food consumption, withdrawing savings, taking children out of school or selling capital assets. Household savings allow the wealthiest households to recover; but for low‐income households, consumption has to be cut, which depletes human capital development and prevents recovery.Rural Vietnamese need more public support to cope with and recover from shocks. Because idiosyncratic shocks hit households hard, public support should focus on alleviating their impacts. Expanding health insurance to all rural households should be a priority.Households suffer less in areas with higher levels of economic development, so economic growth is a defence against shocks. More roads and links to towns and more irrigation would help.",2024.0,Development Policy Review,Development Policy Review,T.

Smoothing consumption in times of illness: Household recourse mechanisms.,"We study the welfare impacts of illness shocks on rural agricultural households in the semi-arid tropical and humid eastern regions of India. These regions are characterized by rainfed agriculture, missing markets for credit and insurance, and limited access to publicly funded healthcare infrastructure. We find that illness shocks increase households' medical expenditures and reduce wage income. However, aggregate non-medical, food, and non-food consumption expenditures are insensitive to illness shocks. Disaggregating illness by the age and the gender of the household members, we observe that illness in male children leads to the largest increase in medical expenditure, and illness in prime-aged adults leads to the largest decline in per-capita wage earnings. We also find illness shocks leading to changes in household dietary diversity, higher travel expenditures, and a compensating reduction in spending on education and entertainment. Analysis of risk-coping strategies reveals that households rely on transfers from kinship networks and loans from informal sources like local moneylenders to smooth consumption. While large landowners rely on gifts from kinship networks, landless and smallholders increase borrowings from informal sources.",2024.0,Health Economics,Health economics,"Abhishek Dureja, D.

Poverty Reduction and Insurance-Based Risk Protection,"This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of poverty reduction and insurance-based risk protection programs in a particular region, another purpose is to analyze the impact of Insurance on systematic risk protection and poverty reduction with a critical analysis approach. The method used involves a survey of a sample of program beneficiary communities as well as primary and secondary data analysis. Data were collected through interviews, observations, and documentation to identify the program's impact on poverty levels and household economic sustainability. The results showed that the program succeeded in increasing people's access to health services and education, as well as reducing financial risks faced by vulnerable households. In addition, this program also contributes positively to local economic growth and financial independence of beneficiary communities. The implications of these findings provide support for government policies to improve the effectiveness of social protection programs and expand health insurance coverage for vulnerable communities to address poverty and economic risks.

The effect of weather index insurance on social capital: Evidence from rural Ethiopia,"We study the effect of weather index insurance (WII) uptake on social capital. We measure individual social capital using experimental and survey‐based measures and relate it to the actual purchase of WII. We use propensity score matching (PSM) and an instrumental variable (IV) to address endogeneity concerns. Our descriptive and PSM estimates show that WII uptake negatively and significantly affects social capital. We find that insured households contribute less to the public good than uninsured households. We also find qualitatively and quantitatively similar results using our IV approach, yet insufficient power renders most of our IV estimates insignificant. We however report robust significant effects of instrumented WII uptake on sociopsychological outcomes—WII uptake increases perceptions of self‐sufficiency and free‐riding behavior: these are potential channels through which a negative effect on social capital comes about. Although far from conclusive, our paper provides several pieces of evidence that suggest WII uptake negatively affects social capital.",2023.0,Journal of Risk and Insurance,Journal of Risk and Insurance,"H.

Vulnerability to seasonal food insecurity as an exposure to risk: the case of the Southern Province of Zambia,"Background Seasonality is an important aspect of food security for subsistence households in developing countries. Among the multidimensional aspects of food security, this paper focuses on how unexpected negative harvest shocks would affect the seasonal food consumption of households. This is particularly important because, with the increasing threat of climate change, the frequency of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods is expected to increase; this would adversely affect crop yields. Methods Given seasonal price changes of staple foods, some households buy them when prices are low and store them for the hunger season (not buy high (NBH) households), while others run out of staple foods before the next harvest and therefore buy them when prices are high (buy high (BH) households). Using three years of weekly household panel data for the Choma and Sinazongwe Districts of the southern province of Zambia, we assess the ability of seasonal consumption smoothing separately for NBH and BH households. Results NBH households successfully smooth their consumption over the 12 months of the crop year. In contrast, BH households, especially for households with few assets, reduce total consumption in response to harvest shocks, just after the harvest and during the “hunger season” just before the next harvest. However, in spite of this, the consumption of staple foods is generally insensitive to harvest shocks. Instead, they reduce consumption only of non-staple food items, such as vegetables and meats. Conclusions Seasonal food insecurity is exacerbated by negative harvest shocks. We emphasize the significance of policies aimed at increasing public awareness of healthier food choices, empowering households to avoid purchasing maize at high prices, and reducing seasonal price disparities.",2023.0,Agriculture & Food Security,Agriculture & Food Security,"Akinori Kitsuki, Takeshi Sakurai",10.1186/s40066-023-00442-4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7ba61891671b95598858d21b06b2431bd80fb84f,69.0,2.0,0.0,,"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Environmental Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://agricultureandfoodsecurity.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s40066-023-00442-4,['JournalArticle'],2023-10-24,True,True
Quantifying Vulnerability to Poverty in Rural Manipur: A Study of Agricultural Households from NSSO 70th Round Data,"Poverty is a stochastic phenomenon as the economic status of a household can change in the face of shocks and in the absence of resources to mitigate the effect of shocks. Thus, a static measure of poverty may not be very reliable for policy formulation. This article attempts to analyse the level of vulnerability to poverty across rural agricultural households by using 3 stage feasible generalized least square (3S FGLS) method and examines the determinants of households’ vulnerability to poverty by logistic regression. In addition, a concerted effort is made to explore the similarities and differences between the determinants of vulnerability and those of poverty. The study used NSSO 70th round (2012–2013) Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households data. The analysis reveals most of the determinants of poverty and vulnerability to be similar although it differs in strength on the impacts and significance level. The FGLS estimates show that the vulnerability of household level is much higher at 50.07% as compared to poverty rate, which is at 43.52% in the study area. Education of the household head, diversification of economic activities and social safety nets are found to be very significant in reducing vulnerability of a household.

Supply-side factors and uptake of insurance products among Ghanaian households,"Abstract This study examines the influence of supply-side factors on uptake of insurance, as well the moderating effect of sales agent effectiveness on the interactions. A survey research design was adopted following a quantitative approach. The target population of this study comprised Ghanaian households of income earning groups (earning less than US$190; earning between US$191 and US$1,000; as well as earning US$1,000). Using a cross-sectional survey, a structured questionnaire was administered to 520 households that participated in the survey following a convenience sampling technique in line with the ethical considerations in social science research. The formulated hypotheses were tested using hierarchical regression analyses for the direct and moderating relationships. The results show that three supply-side factors influencing insurance uptake are insurance product design, customer service, and market positioning. The relationships between insurance product design, customer service, market positioning, and insurance uptake become stronger with higher levels of sales agent effectiveness. The implications for practice point to the need for a concerted effort on development of insurance products across the income brackets, offering insurance product cost suitable for each income group and providing adequate awareness to enhance uptake of insurance products.",2023.0,Cogent Business &amp; Management,Cogent Business & Management,"Justice Ofori, F.

Is Mobile Money Changing Rural Africa? Evidence from a Field Experiment,"
 Rural areas in Sub-Saharan Africa are typically underserved by financial services. Mobile money brings a substantial reduction in the transaction costs of remittances. We follow the introduction of mobile money for the first time in rural villages of Mozambique using a randomized field experiment. We find that mobile money increased migration out of these villages, where we observe lower agricultural activity and investment. At the same time, remittances received and welfare of rural households increased, particularly when facing geo-referenced village-level floods and household-level idiosyncratic shocks.

Propagation and Insurance in Village Networks,"In village economies, small firm owners facing idiosyncratic shocks adjust production by cutting spending and reducing employment. Households with whom they trade inputs and labor scale back their own businesses and reduce consumption. As effects reverberate through local economies, the aggregate indirect adverse effects are larger than the direct effects. Propagation is more severe when transmitted through labor networks as opposed to material supply-chain networks, and goes beyond input-output/sectoral considerations as it varies with network position, closeness to a shocked household, and network density. Participation in gift-giving insurance networks mitigates direct and hence indirect effects. Supply chain and labor networks are fragile as the broken links are not easily replaced, leading to persistent damage.

Risk Pooling and Precautionary Saving in Village Economies,"We propose a new method to test for eﬃcient risk pooling that allows for intertemporal smoothing, non-homothetic consumption, and heterogeneous risk and time preferences. The method is composed of three steps. The ﬁrst one allows for precautionary savings by the aggregate risk pooling group. The second utilizes the inverse Engel curve to estimate good-speciﬁc tests for eﬃcient risk pooling. In the third step, we obtain consistent estimates of households’ risk and time preferences using a full risk sharing model, and incorporate heterogeneous preferences in testing for risk pooling. We apply this method to panel data from Indian villages to generate a number of new insights. We ﬁnd that food expenditures are better protected from aggregate shocks than non-food consumption, after accounting for non-homotheticity. Village-level consumption tracks aggregate village cash-in-hand, suggesting some form of coordinated precautionary savings. But there is considerable excess sensitivity to aggregate income, indicating a lack of full asset integration.

Coping with the consequences of short-term illness shocks: The role of intra-household labor substitution.,"In developing countries where medical infrastructure, service delivery systems, and the markets for health insurance are underdeveloped, one important mechanism to cope with the consequences of health shocks is the intra-household substitution of labor. This paper studies the impact of short-term illness shocks on labor supply and wage earnings of prime-aged individuals using data from agricultural households in India. It also documents the compensating intra-household labor supply responses of other non-ill members of the household. We find that an illness shock reduces an individual's monthly wage earnings by 7.1% via the decline in the individual's days of employment in the labor market. Further, an illness shock to the household head causes a compensating increase in the wage labor supply of the wife. An illness shock to the wife, however, induces the household head to devote more time to domestic activities. The compensating labor supply responses are only partially able to insure the loss in total wage income of the household. Our results indicate that the gender-based specialization of labor weakens in the event of an illness shock.",2022.0,Health Economics,Health economics,"Abhishek Dureja, D.

Unemployment and Household Spending in Rural and Urban India: Evidence from Panel Data,"Abstract India has seen high levels of unemployment in recent years. Understanding how an episode of job loss affects household consumption expenditure is important for designing effective safety net programs. We apply difference-in-difference and quantile regressions to a high-frequency panel data from a nationally representative survey of 1,75,000 households in 2019 to estimate the impact of a job loss on household consumption expenditure – for urban and rural households, and households across different expenditure levels. We find that the loss of employment of an earning member leads to a significant immediate decline in household consumption expenditure. The decline is larger for urban households and households in the lowest and the highest income deciles. Durable and discretionary expenses go down the most. Expenditure on health and education also goes down significantly, especially, in urban areas. Our findings highlight the high vulnerability of urban households to economic shocks and can inform the design and targeting of income support and other safety-net programmes in India and other developing countries.",2022.0,,The Journal of Development Studies,"Manavi Gupta, A.

A behavioral decomposition of willingness to pay for health insurance,"Despite widespread exposure to substantial medical expenditure risk in low-income populations, health insurance enrollment is typically low. This is puzzling from the perspective of expected utility theory. To help explain it, this paper introduces a decomposition of the stated willingness to pay (WTP) for insurance into its fair price and three behavioral deviations from that price due to risk perception and risk attitude consistent with prospect theory, plus a residual. To apply this approach, we elicit WTP, subjective distributions of medical expenditures and risk attitude (utility curvature and probability weighting) from Filipino households in a nationwide survey. We find that the mean stated WTP of the uninsured is less than both the actuarially fair price and the subsidized price at which public insurance is offered. This is not explained by downwardly biased beliefs: both the mean and the median subjective expectation are greater than the subsidized price. Convex utility in the domain of losses pushes mean WTP below the fair price and the subsidized price, and the transformation of probabilities into decision weights depresses the mean further, at least using one of two specific decompositions. WTP is reduced further by factors other than risk perception and attitude.",2022.0,Journal of Risk and Uncertainty,Journal of Risk and Uncertainty,"A. Baillon, Aleli D. Kraft, O.

Inequality in India Declined During COVID,"We use a large, representative panel data set from India with monthly data on household finances to examine the incidence of economic harms during the COVID pandemic. We observe a sharp spike in poverty, peaking during India’s sharp but short lockdown. However, there was a striking decrease in income inequality outside the lockdown. There was a smaller decrease in consumption inequality, likely due to consumption smoothing. Evidence supports two mechanisms for the decline in income inequality: the capital income of top-quartile earners covaries more with aggregate income, and demand for labor fell more for higher quartiles. *Gupta: New York University; Malani: University of Chicago; Woda: University of Chicago.

"Friendship, kinship and social risk management strategies among pastoralists in Karamoja, Uganda","This paper describes risk-pooling friendships and other social networks among pastoralists in Karamoja, Uganda. Social networks are of critical importance for risk management in an environment marked by volatility and uncertainty. Risk management or risk pooling mainly takes the form of “stock friendships”: an informal insurance system in which men established mutually beneficial partnerships with unrelated or related individuals through livestock transfers in the form of gifts or loans. Friends accepted the obligation to assist each other during need, ranging from the time of marriage to times of distress. Anthropologists and economists claim that social networks are critical for recouping short-term losses such as food shortage, as well as for ensuring long-term sustainability through the building of social capital and rebuilding of herds. To this end, I present ethnographic data on friendship, kinship, and other networks among male and female pastoralists in Karamoja. Using qualitative and quantitative data on these relationships and norms of livestock transfers and other mutual aid, I show the enduring importance of social networks in the life of Karamoja’s pastoralists today. I also demonstrate how exchange networks were utilized by participants during a drought. On this basis, I argue that appreciating historical and traditional mechanisms of resilience among pastoralists is vital for designing community-based risk management projects. I discuss how traditional safety net systems have been used successfully by NGOs to assist pastoralists in the wake of disaster, and how the same can be done by harnessing risk-pooling friendships in Karamoja.",2021.0,Pastoralism,Pastoralism,Padmini Iyer,10.1186/s13570-020-00182-1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d57159af3040146400bcf5ce4e30b98adc299b20,69.0,7.0,0.0,,"[{'category': 'Sociology', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://pastoralismjournal.springeropen.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13570-020-00182-1,,2021-11-24,True,True
Illness and Wage Loss: Longitudinal Evidence from India (and Implications for the Universal Health Coverage Agenda),"Background: A key aim of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is to protect individuals and households against the financial risk of illness. Large-scale health insurance expansions are therefore a central focus of the UHC agenda. Importantly, however, health insurance does not protect against a key dimension of financial risk associated with illness: forgone wage income (due to short-term disability). In this paper, we quantify the economic burden of illness in India attributable--separately--to wage loss and to medical care spending, as well as differences in them across the socio-economic distribution. Methods: We use data from two Indian longitudinal household surveys: (i) the Village Dynamics in South Asia (VDSA) survey (1,350 households surveyed every month for 60 months between 2010 and 2015) and (ii) the Indian Human Development Survey (IHDS) (more than 40,000 households surveyed in 2005 and again in 2011). The VDSA allows us to study the economic dynamics of illness using high-frequency observations, and the IHDS allows us to confirm our findings in a nationally-representative sample. Both contain individual- and household-level information about illness, wage income, and medical spending over time. We use longitudinal variation in illness to estimate regression models of economic burden separately for wage loss and medical care spending across the socio-economic distribution. Our regression models include a series of fixed effects that control for differences in time-invariant household (or individual) characteristics and time-varying factors common across households. Findings: 1,184 households (88%) in the VDSA sample reported an episode of illness over 60 months, and 15770 households (40%) in the IHDS reported an illness in the preceding year. In the VDSA sample, on average, a day of illness was associated with a reduction in monthly per capita wage income of Rs 77 [95% CI -99 to -57] and an increase in monthly per capita medical spending of Rs 126 [95% CI 110-142]. Variation across the socio-economic distribution was substantial. Among the poorest households, wage loss due to illness is roughly 15% of total household spending--nearly three times greater than medical spending. Alternatively, among the most affluent households, wage loss is less than 5% of total household spending--and only one-third of medical spending. Put differently, wage loss accounts for more than 80% of the total economic burden of illness among the poorest households, but only about 20% of the economic burden of illness among the most affluent. Estimates from the IHDS sample show that this socio-economic gradient is present in the Indian population generally. Interpretation: Wage loss accounts for a substantial share of the total economic burden of illness in India--and disproportionately so among the poorest households. If Universal Health Coverage truly aims to protect households against the financial risk of illness--particularly poor households, the inclusion of wage loss insurance or another illness-related income replacement benefit is needed.",2021.0,medRxiv,,"A.

Households’ Risk Management and Coping Strategies: How do the Poor Respond to Various Idiosyncratic and Covariate Shocks in Pakistan?,"This study examines poor households’ vulnerability to idiosyncratic and covariate shocks in Pakistan. First, it observes households’ socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic factors that influence the incidence of shocks. Second, it examines households coping strategies adopted to mitigate the negative effects of these shocks. For this purpose, we have studied the shock patterns in poor households and examined the role of the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) in protecting these households against various shocks. Results indicate simultaneous exposure of idiosyncratic and covariate shocks to the targeted households. Moreover, with a low level of physical and financial assets owned by these households, they resort to coping strategies which are further damaging in nature. We also analyzed shock coping strategies of the sampled households and found that informal coping mechanisms are more prevalent among the poor households when hit by shocks. We have concluded that BISP is ineffective in protecting households in times of shocks and it is thus suggested that the transfers under this program should be generous in size and responsive to shocks in order to be an effective coping strategy for the poor.",2021.0,Journal of Asian and African Studies,Journal of Asian and African Studies,"Neelum Nigar, Unbreen Qayyum",10.1177/00219096211038651,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/070a889c952e33b693751de6eb06f1d32a70f2e5,56.0,3.0,0.0,['Economics'],"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Sociology', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",False,,['JournalArticle'],2021-08-10,True,True
Does Inequality Impede Risk Management? Evidence from a Lab-in-the-Field Experiment in Ghana,"Low income households in agrarian developing economies continue to face considerable livelihood risks, which have serious negative impacts on household welfare. Incomplete financial markets present an external constraint on risk management and are well studied in the literature. A growing literature has focused on internal constraints on development, which can negatively affect saving and investment behavior. Here I propose that internal constraints may also hinder risk management. Specifically, I propose that fairness preferences may create an internal constraint on risk-sharing, particularly in a context of wealth inequality. To test this theory, I utilize a lab-in-the-field experiment to investigate the impact of wealth inequality on utilization of risk-management tools and explore how fairness preferences may mediate this effect. I find that inequality reduces risk-sharing and increases demand for insurance. Moreover, I find evidence that fairness preferences create an internal constraint on risk-sharing under inequality.",2021.0,Social Science Research Network,ERN: Consumption; Saving (Consumption) (Topic),Richard A.

Economic Consequences of Ill-Health in Rural Ethiopia,"ABSTRACT We use three years of household panel data to analyze the effects of ill-health on household economic outcomes in rural Ethiopia. We examine the immediate effects of various ill-health measures on health expenditure and labor supply, the subsequent coping responses, and finally the effect on income and consumption. We find evidence of substantial economic risk in terms of increased health expenditure and reduced agricultural productivity. Households are able to smooth consumption by resorting to intra-household labor substitution, borrowing and depleting assets. However, maintaining current consumption through borrowing and depletion of assets is unlikely to be sustainable and displays the need for health financing reforms and safety nets that reduce the financial consequences of ill-health.",2021.0,Health systems and reform,Health Systems & Reform,"Z.

Delivering health insurance through informal financial groups: Evidence on moral hazard and adverse selection.,"Moral hazard and adverse selection are potential explanations for missing health insurance in low-income countries. In recent years, informal financial institutions have attempted to complete health insurance markets by offering micro health insurance (MHI). We evaluate an MHI offered through informal financial institutions (Self-Help Groups) in Maharashtra, India. Exploiting random assignment of when villages were offered the MHI, we do not find support for MHI increasing health care utilization. In contrast, we do find evidence for adverse selection: enrollees are significantly more likely than non-enrollees to report poor health prior to the introduction of MHI. This adverse selection persists even when the MHI is offered as a group insurance to Self-Help Groups, as opposed to individual insurance. Our results suggest that MHI offered through informal financial groups may not suffer from moral hazard, but does fall short of eliminating adverse selection.",2021.0,Health Economics,Health economics,K.

The Impacts of Microcredit on Informal Risk Sharing: Experimental Evidence from China,"This study examines the impacts of a large-scale government-led microcredit program on informal risk sharing among poor households in rural China based on a randomized controlled trial. The results show that financial inclusion, on average, reduced households’ borrowing from informal financial networks, and informal borrowing decreased substantially among households that were program members, regardless of whether they had borrowed from the program. Further analyses suggest that the program alleviated the dependence on informal financial networks to afford consumption shocks for program members who did not obtain program loans, and the crowding-out effect on informal borrowing existed even during the announcement period of the program for these households. These results are consistent with limited commitment models, which predict that access to microcredit raises the expected value of autarky utility relative to the utility derived from risk-pooling arrangements, and thus reduces the scope of implementable risk-sharing contracts.",2021.0,,Randomized Social Experiments eJournal,Shu Cai,10.2139/ssrn.3859868,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32ebf29b36c25ef8f2399f7ddfe9de8c6cb1cf22,45.0,1.0,0.0,,"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",False,,,2021-04-20,True,True

Subsidising Inclusive Insurance to Reduce Poverty,"In this article, we assess the benefits of coordination and partnerships between governments and private insurers, and provide further evidence for microinsurance products as powerful and cost-effective tools for achieving poverty reduction. To explore these ideas, we model the capital of a household from a ruin-theoretic perspective to measure the impact of microinsurance on poverty dynamics and the governmental cost of social protection. We analyse the model under four frameworks: uninsured, insured (without subsidies), insured with subsidised constant premiums and insured with subsidised flexible premiums. Although insurance alone (without subsidies) may not be sufficient to reduce the likelihood of falling into the area of poverty for specific groups of households, since premium payments constrain their capital growth, our analysis suggests that subsidised schemes can provide maximum social benefits while reducing governmental costs.",2021.0,,,"J.

Distinguishing Barriers to Insurance in Thai Villages,"Informal insurance is an important risk-coping mechanism in developing countries, yet this risk sharing is incomplete.

This work shows that the way history matters in forecasting consumption can be used to distinguish hidden income from limited commitment and moral hazard.

Quantifying Vulnerability to Poverty in the Drought-Prone Lowlands of Ethiopia,"
 A forward-looking measure of ‘vulnerability to poverty’ is estimated and a concerted effort is made to understand the sources of vulnerability in the drought-prone lowlands of Ethiopia. Using the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey and the Welfare Monitoring Survey of 2015–16, which include additional zones in the Afar and Somali regions increasing the representativeness of the survey in pastoral areas, the analysis reveals that vulnerability is remarkably higher in the drought-prone lowlands than in the other ecological zones, even though differences in poverty rates are modest. The analysis also reveals important distinctions in the sources of vulnerability. In the drought-prone lowlands, (i) the prevalence of both poverty-induced and risk-induced vulnerability is the highest among all the ecological zones and (ii) the importance of vulnerability due to aggregate shocks, such as droughts, relative to vulnerability due to idiosyncratic shocks is higher than in the other ecological zones. These findings attest to the unique nature of the drought-prone lowlands in comparison to the other agroecological zones of Ethiopia and the need for adaptive social protection programmes targeting not only the chronically poor but also the vulnerable.",2021.0,Policy Research Working Papers,Policy Research Working Papers,"E.

Community Membership and Reciprocity in Lending: Evidence from Informal Markets,"We study how wholesalers extend trade credit to retailers in economies where formal market institutions, such as financial reporting systems, auditing, and courts, are nonexistent or function poorly. Using the setting of a large market in the northeastern part of India, we find that community membership plays a strong role in the access to trade credit. Wholesalers are more likely to provide trade credit and offer less restrictive credit terms to within-community retailers, are more lenient when these retailers default, and are less likely to experience defaults from them. We show that this cooperation between same-community wholesalers and retailers is achieved through a reciprocity mechanism, which provides insurance against income shocks.",2021.0,Social Science Research Network,Chicago Booth: Accounting Research Center Research Paper Series,"R.

Poverty Alleviation and Interhousehold Transfers: Evidence from BRAC’s Graduation Program in Bangladesh,"
 Poor households often rely on transfers from their social networks for consumption smoothing, yet there is limited evidence on how antipoverty programs affect informal transfers. This paper exploits the randomized rollout of BRAC’s ultra-poor graduation program in Bangladesh and panel data covering over 21,000 households over seven years to study the program’s effects on interhousehold transfers. The program crowds out informal transfers received by the targeted households, but this is driven mainly by outside-village transfers. Treated ultra-poor households become more likely to both give and receive transfers to/from wealthier households within their village; and less likely to receive transfers from their employers. As a result, the reciprocity of their within-village transfers increases. The findings imply that, within rural communities, there is positive assortative matching by socio-economic status. A reduction in poverty enables households to engage more in reciprocal transfer arrangements and lowers the interlinkage of their labor with informal insurance.",2020.0,World Bank Economic Review,The World Bank Economic Review,Selim Gulesci,10.1093/wber/lhaa023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3fe37bbf14ba99deb30cc8179ec6c395b63d4ad1,85.0,3.0,0.0,['Business'],"[{'category': 'Business', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstreams/cc514895-f366-5e31-b060-cf9edba1b120/download,['Book'],2020-11-04,True,True
Five Years of Regional Risk Pooling: An Updated Cost-Benefit Analysis of the African Risk Capacity,"An initial cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of the African Risk Capacity (ARC), published in 2013, showed that regional risk pooling for severe droughts could increase benefits to poor households by as much as US$ 1.90 per dollar invested, due to the speed, cost and targeting gains from improved risk financing and contingency planning of a humanitarian response. We revisit the assumptions underpinning this initial CBA to reflect current ARC operations, and we update the CBA using new methods for evaluating the costs and benefits of regional risk pooling to finance disaster risk management. Under the revised methods and assumptions, the increase in benefits to the poor will have exceeded the costs of regional risk pooling, but not by as much as US$ 1.90 per dollar invested. This is because ARC premiums have been higher than assumed in the initial CBA, and insured countries have used ARC payouts mainly to distribute food aid, instead of leveraging state-contingent welfare schemes with potentially larger speed, cost and targeting gains.

Do Informal Transfers Induce Lower Efforts? Evidence from Lab-in-the-Field Experiments in Rural Mexico,"How do informal transfers affect work incentives? The question matters in developing countries, where labor markets are intertwined with transfer networks. The tax-and-subsidy component of transfers would dilute work incentives, but their prosocial element could encourage people to work harder. Such crosscurrents are hard to disentangle because participation in informal networks is likely endogenous. We tackle this problem with a lab-in-the-field experiment that uses a real-effort task. Our main finding is that participants do not reduce their effort in the presence of transfers. This suggests that the impact of informal transfers may extend beyond just the sharing of risk.",2020.0,Economic development and cultural change,Economic Development and Cultural Change,"Ingela Alger, Laura Juárez, Miriam Juárez-Torres, Josepa Miquel-Florensa",10.1086/702858,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed9e0699d9e422e0e0c57653780920a6498da35f,82.0,5.0,0.0,['Business'],"[{'category': 'Business', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://publications.ut-capitole.fr/id/eprint/26252/1/mexico_2018.pdf,,2020-08-28,True,True
The long-run effects of noncommunicable disease shocks.,"The health shocks literature typically does not take into account the temporal patterns of loss since the time of the shock. This limits understanding of the long-run impact of health shocks and the capacity of individuals to cope over time. This study estimates the dynamic effects of a noncommunicable disease shock on the economic well-being of working-age individuals in China up to 6 years after onset. We find that after a period of temporal loss, individuals and their families can insure consumption against the average noncommunicable disease shock over the long-run. We observe significant heterogeneity according to the persistence of the disease, value of household wealth, and health insurance status. Individuals with consistent onset, with below median wealth, and without health insurance are least equipped to smooth consumption over the long-term.",2020.0,Health Economics,Health economics,"Tianxin Pan, M.

Correlates and impact of crop insurance in India: evidence from a nationally representative survey,"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to identify the correlates of crop insurance adoption and estimate the impact on debt and farm income.Design/methodology/approachThe authors used nationally representative data from National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), which consisted of 35,200 farming households. Logit and propensity score matching (PSM) (nearest neighbor, caliper and kernel matching) techniques were used.FindingsWith only around 5% of households insuring their crops and 87% of them not receiving claims, crop insurance in India has failed. Logit model estimates of correlates of adoption indicated that households with larger family size, lower social group, less education, lower standard of living and poor were more likely to be left out of the ambit of crop insurance. Further, propensity score estimates suggested that households with access to crop insurance had significantly lesser outstanding debt with positive effect on input costs and crop income. The authors’ results were in contrast to the risk balancing theory.Practical implicationsResults of our work encourage us to rethink and restructure the crop insurance policy design in India. With credit and insurance markets interlinked by design and as the risk balancing in the farm business found absent, policies to strengthen both the markets are the need of the hour. To encourage more farmers to take up crop insurance, revenue-based indemnity calculation could be tried in India.Originality/valueImpact estimates from three different algorithms of matching were compared and tested for robustness. Consistent average treatment effect on treated (ATT) was considered for interpretation and policy implications. Since the data are from a nationally representative survey, results are believed to be of extreme value to policy makers and insurance providers as it can be generalized.",2020.0,,Agricultural Finance Review,"A.

Targeting Weather Insurance Markets,"The suitability of insurance products often depends greatly on individual circum- stances.

Using data from a large-scale field experiment, we build and calibrate a model which accounts for household investment decisions, including the scope for self-insurance via labor markets to (risky) wage work.

Enhanced Informal Networks: Costly State Verification and the Village Fund Intervention,"Using data for over 600 households in 16 villages from Townsend Thai project, we find that the role of preexisting informal kinship networks in Thailand was enhanced following a quasi-formal village fund program in 2001. Transfers (gifts) among poor households play a crucial role in funding investment. This transfer mechanism and its role in investment were amplified for the poor households after the village fund, especially those with kinship ties. Moreover, we document a financial regime shift using maximum-likelihood estimation. Two exogenously incomplete regimes (saving only and lending/borrowing) dominated in the full sample and for the relatively poor before the village fund, but costly state verification, a less incomplete financial regime, dominates in the subsample of poor households following the village fund. The structurally-estimated cost of verification of the households with kinship is also significantly lower than the one without kinship after 2001, relative to before, suggesting the role of kinship was enhanced.",2020.0,,Economics of Networks eJournal,"Hong Ru, R.

Does the level of social cultural beliefs affect the level of agreement of the respondents on the motivational dimensions of microinsurance?,"Insurance products and services in general are intended to transfer the risks brought about by both man-made and natural hazards from an individual or an entity to another. But since there is a misconception that insurance offered by commercial insurers are expensive and only for the moneyed consumers, or people need a lot of money to insure, insurance is only good for those who have big businesses or valuable properties. The poor and the vulnerable have relied on informal risk-mitigating measures like community-based insurance system or worst do not have any other means to help them cope and become risk-averse. This misconception has led to the conceptualization of microinsurance as an offshoot to microfinance primarily to offer insurance products and services that are affordable, the contractual obligations of both the insured and the insurer are nonlegalistic and lesser technical to make it more understandable to the intended market. This study aims to assess if social-cultural beliefs affect the level of agreement of the respondents on the motivational dimensions of microinsurance. A descriptive-correlational method was used in this research. A 40-item self-made questionnaire was subjected to validity and reliability tests before the same was distributed to six hundred respondents all over the Philippines. There were 422 retrieved questionnaires which 70% of the total number of questionnaires deployed. Conclusively, the results indicate that the level of agreement of the respondents on the motivational dimensions of microinsurance vary from one factor to another. © 2020 by the authors.

Household risk‐sharing channels,"This paper aims to fill the gaps in the analysis of risk‐sharing channels at the microlevel, both within and across households. Using data from the Bank of Italy's Survey on Household Income and Wealth covering the financial crisis, we are able to quantify in a unified and consistent framework several risk‐sharing mechanisms that so far have been documented separately. We find that Italian households were able to smooth on average about 85% of shocks to household head's earnings in both 2008–2010 and 2010–2012 spells. The most important smoothing mechanisms turn out to be self‐insurance through savings/dissavings (40% and 47% in 2008–2010 and 2010–2012, respectively), and within‐household risk‐sharing (16% and 14%). Interestingly, risk‐sharing through portfolio diversification and private transfers is rather limited, but the overall percentage of shock absorption occurring through private risk‐sharing channels hovers around four‐fifths, as opposed to around one‐fifth of a shock cushioned by taxes and public transfers, excluding pensions. In addition, by exploiting subjective expectations on the following year's household income, we find significant evidence of a lower degree of smoothing of persistent shocks.

for example from observability, verifiability, complexity or cultural constraints. We 
derive necessary and sufficient conditions for Pareto efficiency under these constraints in 
a general setting, and we provide an explicit characterization of Pareto efficient bilateral 
transfer profiles under CARA utility and normally distributed endowments. Our model 
predicts that network centrality is positively correlated with consumption volatility, as 
more central agents become quasi-insurance providers to more peripheral agents. The proposed

Consumption Insurance in Networks with Asymmetric Information,"This paper uses a dataset from Tanzania with information on consumption, income and income shocks within and across family networks. Crucially and uniquely, it also contains data on the degree of information existing between each pair of households within family networks gCrucially and uniquely, it also contains data on the level of information each pair of households has about each other within family networks. We use these data to construct a novel measure of the quality of information both at the level of household pairs and at the level of the network. We also note that the individual level measures can be interpreted as measures of network centrality. We study risk sharing within these networks and explore whether the rejection of perfect risk sharing that we observe can be related to our measures of information quality. We show that households within family networks with better information are less vulnerable to idiosyncratic shocks. Furthermore, we show that more central households within networks are less vulnerable to idiosyncratic shocks.

Experimental identification of asymmetric information: Evidence on crop insurance in the Philippines,"Abstract I study asymmetric information in crop insurance in the Philippines using a two-level randomized field experiment and incentivized preference elicitation. In this first experimental study of moral hazard in non-health insurance, preventable damages double on randomly insured plots among farmers with high trust in the insurance provider. Farmers prefer insurance on plots that are at risk of floods and crop diseases, a sign of classic adverse selection, and plots that are far away from home, a sign of selection on anticipated moral hazard behavior, resulting in 72% higher payouts on preferred plots.

"Wealth, Race, and Consumption Smoothing of Typical Income Shocks","We study the consumption response to typical labor income shocks and investigate how these vary by wealth and race. First, we estimate the elasticity of consumption with respect to income using an instrument based on firm-wide changes in monthly pay. While much of the consumption-smoothing literature uses variation in unusual windfall income, this instrument captures the income variation that households typically experience. In addition, because it can be constructed for every worker in every month, it allows for more precision than most previous estimates. We implement this approach in administrative bank account data and find an average elasticity of 0.23, with a standard error of 0.01. The increased precision also allows us to address an open question about the extent of heterogeneity by wealth in the elasticity. We find a much lower consumption response for high liquidity households, which may help discipline structural consumption models. Second, we use this instrument to study how wealth shapes racial inequality. An extensive body of work documents a substantial racial and ethnic wealth gap. However, less is known about how this gap translates into differences in welfare on a month-to-month basis. We make progress on this question by combining our instrument for typical income volatility with a new dataset linking bank account data with race and Hispanicity. We find that black (Hispanic) households cut their consumption 50 (20) percent more than white households when faced with a similarly-sized income shock. Nearly all of this differential pass-through of income to consumption is explained in a statistical sense by differences in liquid wealth. Combining our empirical estimates with a model, we show that temporary income volatility has a substantial welfare cost for all groups. Because of racial disparities in consumption smoothing, the cost is at least 50 percent higher for black households and 20 percent higher for Hispanic households than it is for white households.",2020.0,Social Science Research Network,NBER Working Paper Series,"Peter Ganong, Damon Jones, P.

Can Insurance Payouts Prevent a Poverty Trap? Evidence from Randomised Experiments in Northern Kenya,"Abstract Index-based insurance can have welfare-enhancing effects through two pathways: by inducing policyholders to change their investment and risk-management decisions or by mitigating weather-related shocks through payouts. Most studies fail to distinguish between these two; thus, we know little about which effects dominate and their long-term welfare implications. This study uses a random distribution of discount coupons and drought events that trigger payouts as exogenous variations in order to identify both the ex ante risk-management and ex post payout effects of index-based livestock insurance in a pastoral-dominant society of northern Kenya, where the literature has detected asset-based poverty traps, represented by bifurcated herd-size dynamics. We find that, first, both risk-management and payout effects help reduce the probability of distress sales of livestock. Second, payout effects also reduce the slaughter of livestock. Finally, while payout effects remain robust for the sub-sample of poorer households below the poverty-trap threshold, statistically significant risk-management effects on reduced livestock sales disappear for them. Overall, our results suggest that insurance payouts can help the poor escape poverty traps, while the impact of behavioural changes accompanied by insurance purchases is more subtle in our settings.",2020.0,Journal of Development Studies,The Journal of Development Studies,"Yuma Noritomo, Kazushi Takahashi",10.1080/00220388.2020.1736281,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/03f28da9dcfd44a0edda4548181bbff4ae2c6faa,51.0,22.0,1.0,['Economics'],"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Environmental Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Can_Insurance_Payouts_Prevent_a_Poverty_Trap_Evidence_from_Randomised_Experiments_in_Northern_Kenya/11988060/1/files/22017891.pdf,,2020-03-16,True,True
New Evidence on International Risk-Sharing in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS),"Abstract This paper explores income and consumption smoothing patterns among ECOWAS countries during the period 1980–2016. It is relevant given the willingness of heads of state in the region to create a single currency. Indeed, in a monetary union, asymmetric shocks are not problematic if risk-sharing mechanisms, other than the exchange rate, are in place to allow countries to adjust to specific shocks. The paper provides more information on the accounting decomposition of national aggregates allowing a better understanding of risk-sharing channels. Unlike previous studies in this area, we show that official development assistance and gross saving smooth out asymmetric shocks between ECOWAS countries. Besides, net taxes on products and production, respectively, social contributions and social benefits limit net primary incomes’ effectiveness, respectively, net secondary incomes to smooth asymmetric shocks. Moreover, we show that even if the degree of risk-sharing increases over time, it has remained limited. Also, market- based risk-sharing mechanisms are ineffective when they are most needed. That’s why ECOWAS countries need a supranational fiscal that could provide an additional tool to smooth asymmetric shocks in the region.",2020.0,The International Economy,ERN: Africa (Development) (Topic),Stéphane Zouri,10.2139/ssrn.3541780,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d1c3a4df138e4a9866d51e1dbe1df7cb4704a92d,92.0,6.0,0.0,['Economics'],"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",False,,,2020-02-20,True,True

We introduce a market-priced rainfall deficit insurance product through producer cooperatives, and test a number of potential ways to kick-start private demand. Takeup of the insurance at market prices is very low, between .5% and 3% across seasons, but a low-cost promotion at baseline increases willingness to pay for multiple seasons. When we use a randomized experiment to distribute small free insurance contracts to farmers, 39% of subsidized individuals enroll but this fails to stimulate input use, yields, or income, and nor does it enhance demand in subsequent seasons.

"Health shocks, medical insurance and household vulnerability: Evidence from South Africa","Background South Africa has a dual system of healthcare model differentiated across socio-economic lines. While on the one hand there exists high quality private facilities that is expensive and accessible to the minority, on the other is the free but stretched and over-crowded public healthcare that the rest of the population relies on. Accessing private facilities requires private medical insurance or requires coping strategies that can lead to household vulnerability. Objective The objective of this study is to analyse the relationship between health shocks and household vulnerability in the South African context of high poverty and low medical insurance penetration rate. Data The study employs data from waves three to five of South Africa’s nationally representative National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) conducted between the period 2012–2017 in approximately two-year intervals. Methods Using food expenditure shock as an indicator for vulnerability, the study utilises a range of econometric techniques from panel logit regression to quasi-experimental design based difference in difference regressions to assess the association between health shocks, medical insurance and household vulnerability. Findings The main finding of the study is that a significant proportion of households in the upper income quintile utilise private healthcare even when not covered by private medical insurance. This preference for private over public health facilities make them vulnerable to health shocks as they cope by sacrificing food consumption to incur additional health expenditure. In contrast, lower income households that are unable to access the high-cost private healthcare tend to rely on the strained public healthcare system. They are not able to use their constrained food expenditure as a coping strategy for private or out-of-pocket medical expenses because their food consumption is already at a bare minimum. Conclusion The results confirm that access to quality healthcare is a privilege in South Africa, available only to the minority of the population. The study paints a grim picture of household vulnerability in South Africa and underlines the need for a National Health Insurance that would enable universal access to quality healthcare in the country.",2020.0,PLoS ONE,PLoS ONE,"Pheeha Morudu, Umakrishnan Kollamparambil",10.1371/journal.pone.0228034.r001,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/94bed3f4a9bb15c523006fc88bff1af18d44085f,61.0,20.0,0.0,"['Medicine', 'Business']","[{'category': 'Medicine', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Business', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Medicine', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://storage.googleapis.com/plos-corpus-prod/10.1371/journal.pone.0228034/1/pone.0228034.pdf?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=wombat-sa%40plos-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com%2F20210218%2Fauto%2Fstorage%2Fgoog4_request&X-Goog-Date=20210218T134915Z&X-Goog-Expires=3600&X-Goog-SignedHeaders=host&X-Goog-Signature=674152afbfb2ef0322a5b413ab47aca23c529b30511f490470b5b159a8ee9627f706eabc9f9cd1fa01c859f2f0a07016a1c0584097702d42794c01849c27af7d63924783fedf3142e4334f3662ea75b67e3858e54873125c046f93b49084f0c339cafc0ef93498b0b60096cffc345be8a2781ff7c2eacf7f074692bb33968a9a8682e9f1991ddf064f0dacec5f27c6653fb7a4dc368a8c3312d3b12ad7c82c7dfc02d5e82c72db2b33370ed3ecdb6e61229e1a203db8f660e44e500902d2010b76395788faa96b01c045acee08a2b655e6b61e12905282759305ea2f13467a7f4ae13687c5d60d4e48dd230c909ebf8c4433842e1cb2c721dd31c8aff01cf7b7,['JournalArticle'],2020-02-07,True,True
Household Inequality and Risk Sharing in Australia,"ABSTRACT This study presents estimates of multidimensional household inequality in Australia from 2001 to 2017. Earnings inequality declines through the sample, while disposable income, non-durable consumption expenditures, food expenditures and net worth inequality exhibit relatively flat trends. The relatively flat trend for non-durable expenditures inequality, even over the life cycle, suggests households insure consumption against idiosyncratic shocks. Standard regression estimates of consumption growth against income shocks confirm this finding.

I test the insurance role of transfers sent and received by young migrants by estimating the causal impact of income shocks in the migrants’ locations of origin and destination on inter-household transfers. Rainfall shocks are found to lead to changes in income but not in consumption, indicating that households are able to smooth consumption. I find that young migrants provide insurance to their original households and that the level of insurance increases when migrants and households are exposed to low correlated rainfall shocks. This article shows evidence of bilateral insurance between rural migrants and their original households when the differences in the intensity of the shocks increase. These results provide new evidence of risk-sharing strategies among households geographically spread around a country.",2019.0,Journal of Development Studies,The Journal of Development Studies,T.

Mitigating risk for floodplain agriculture in Amazonia: a role for index-based flood insurance,"ABSTRACT The fertile floodplain of the Amazon river offers considerable potential for agriculture, yet it is a risk-filled environment with heightened vulnerability due to climate change. The annual flood pulse deposits nutrient-rich sediment on the floodplain enabling increased agricultural productivity during the low water season. However, crops growing on the floodplain are at high risk of loss due to flood dynamics. Drawing on data from household surveys (n = 83), focus group discussions, and key informant interviews, this study assesses potential flood risk mitigation tools for floodplain rice farmers along the Amazon river near Iquitos, Peru. Farmers’ risk mitigation preferences are explored through willingness to pay (WTP) methods for flood-tolerant rice varieties, river information services, and index-based flood insurance. Results indicate that measured ambiguity aversion is a key driver in the decision to mitigate flood risk. The study suggests that the environmental risk context may be appropriate for an index-based flood insurance product, and farmers and local institutions see the promise of flood insurance. With climate change scenarios predicting greater variability in the flood regime, mitigating flood risk is paramount to reducing the vulnerabilities and unlocking opportunities for floodplain farmers in Amazonia.",2019.0,Climate and Development,Climate and Development,"G.

The Demand for Health Insurance in a Poor Economy: Evidence from Burkina Faso,"We investigate the properties of health insurance demand in Burkina Faso, where we offered poor households a voluntary health insurance product at half the usual price. The targeting procedure we implemented delivers a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, which identifies the price elasticity of demand for health insurance as well as associated selection effects. We find large price elasticities among urban households, whereas the demand of rural households is price inelastic. There are important selection effects, with widowed male household heads being most price sensitive. Correlating these heterogeneous effects with survey data on informal transfers and health expenditures, our results suggest that informal risk sharing largely crowds out formal insurance and that a single insurance product may fail to align with poor households’ small health budgets. We find no adverse selection into health insurance.",2019.0,Economic development and cultural change,Economic Development and Cultural Change,"Michael Hillebrecht, Stefan Klonner, R. Sauerborn, A.

The Social Value of Health Insurance Results from Ghana,"This paper uses the roll-out of the national health insurance in Ghana to assess the cushioning effect of coverage on the financial consequences of health shocks and resulting changes in coping behaviors. The analysis finds a strong reduction in medical expenditures, preventing households from cutting non-food consumption and causing a decrease in the volume of received remittances as well as the labor supply of healthy adult household members. Moreover, the paper presents evidence that the insurance scheme reduced the likelihood that households experiencing a health shock pulled their children out of school to put them to work.

A behavioral decomposition of willingness to pay for health insurance,"Despite widespread exposure to substantial medical expenditure risk in low-income populations, health insurance enrollment is typically low. This is puzzling from the perspective of expected utility theory. To help explain it, this paper introduces a decomposition of the stated willingness to pay (WTP) for insurance into its fair price and three behavioral deviations from that price due to risk perception and risk attitude consistent with prospect theory, plus a residual. To apply this approach, we elicit WTP, subjective distributions of medical expenditures and risk attitude (utility curvature and probability weighting) from Filipino households in a nationwide survey. We find that the mean stated WTP of the uninsured is less than both the actuarially fair price and the subsidized price at which public insurance is offered. This is not explained by downwardly biased beliefs: both the mean and the median subjective expectation are greater than the subsidized price. Convex utility in the domain of losses pushes mean WTP below the fair price and the subsidized price, and the transformation of probabilities into decision weights depresses the mean further, at least using one of two specific decompositions. WTP is reduced further by factors other than risk perception and attitude.",2019.0,Social Science Research Network,Journal of Risk and Uncertainty,"A. Baillon, Aleli D. Kraft, O.

Post-Adversities Recovery and Profitability: The Case of Italian Farmers,"Insurance represents one of the main instruments, together with other risk management mechanisms, to face the adverse effects produced by natural calamity that, despite their growing intensity and the enormous costs, are still perceived as “exceptional”. Risk management is an important part of farming, and it is a concern for those governments which aim at achieving their agricultural policy targets. In this context, crop insurance can also represent a financial mitigation tool for farmers to face climate change consequences. This study is focused on the Italian case analyzing the evolution of public support and its effect on risk management policy in agriculture. Our research, based on panel data regressions, provides two different levels of analysis. The first one evaluates how the reimbursed value issued by insurance companies in favor of agricultural firms, as recovery from natural adversities, affects farmers’ profitability. The second one evaluates how the reimbursed value is used in farm management. The results of the analysis demonstrating the significance of insurance variables and their positive effect on the profitability of the farms, represent a strong advance in the farm risk management field",2019.0,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Donatella Porrini, Giulio Fusco, P.

Social Capital and Household Welfare: A Review of Contemporary Empirical Literature,"Most studies on social capital especially in Africa, have adopted econometric models in explaining its role in the different developmental paths of societies with similar endowments. From a historical perspective, relying on aggregative national survey data on social welfare, ‘wellbeing’, ‘national happiness index’ to an examination using increasingly structured proximate measures of formal community organisational activities, in particular, membership participation and benefits and their impact on the rural household welfare, almost to the exclusion of informal social capital. Although the influence of technology, especially with the increasing penetration, access and massive impact of the social media have stimulated further research interest in social capital, particularly in Europe and America, econometric modeling and analytical techniques still dominates, while most African researchers have been more interested in how formal social capital impact the welfare of the poor rural farming households as a way to develop rural communities. This paper argues, following an extensive review of the literature that the fixation with ‘econometric analysis’ and ‘formal social capital’, presents only a partial view it does not explain the significant role of informal social capital resources that inhere in informal, yet durable social networks and relations that characterise the community social structure and are encapsulated in its social history. The paper further opines that greater attention should be given to the role of informal social capital in rural household welfare enhancement towards creating a structured role for kinship based groups in the development process, stripping them of the ‘negative’, ‘anti-development’ toga and optimise their potential capacity for mobilisation of rural poor households for active participation in the design and implementation of pro-poor policies and schemes. It would also help redirect research efforts and provide the much-needed evidence for realistic policies especially on ‘bottom-up’, community participatory implementation strategy for developing rural communities.

The rationale is to justifythe need for a new perspective, against the background of the contemporaneous nature of factors in the development process and the search for a sustainable development strategy evident in the SDGs project targets (UNDP, 2016). 2. Development of the Concept of Social Capital The concept ‘social capital’ can be traced back to the history of socioeconomic thought, especially in the works of Durkheim, Marx and De Tocqueville (Halpern, 2005, Putnam, 2001). As Portes (1998) argued, the concept behind social capital is nothing new in sociological terms, considering Durkheim’s emphasis on being connected in a community as an ‘antidote to anomie and self-destruction’. Hanifan (1916, 1920), used it to describe those ‘tangible assets that count for most in daily lives of people...I make no reference to the usual acceptation of the term capital, except in a figurative sense. I do not refer to real estate, or to personal property or to cold cash, but rather to that in life, which tends to make these tangible substances count for most in the daily lives of a people, namely, goodwill, fellowship, mutual sympathy and social intercourse among a group of individuals and families who make up a social unit, the rural community...’ (Hanifan, 1916: 130). The basic idea of ‘social capital’ is that one’s family, friends, and associates, membership of groups/networks, (by birth or admission) constitute an important asset, that can be called upon in a crisis, enjoyed for its own sake, and/or leveraged for material gain (Woolcock & Narayan, 2002). It is about the norms, obligations, communal values, rules and trust embedded in both formal and informal (but durable) networks and social relations – the totality of a community’s social structure and institutional arrangements – that enable its members to pursue and achieve their individual and or collective goals through which their welfare is enhanced and yet communal and community life is preserved. As noted by the World Bank (2000) ‘social norms and networks are a key form of capital that people can use to move out of poverty’. The nature of their informal and or civic engagements may be determined by their immediate need or situation, personal or collective interest and or circumstances of social history, ethnic antecedents or sentiments, which define how the perceived membership or indigene benefits and privileges built during interactions that occur for several reasons, are appropriated (Durston, 1999, 2004, Levien, 2015, Onyemenam, 2017). Most studies have been influenced by this approach to the conceptualization and characterization of social capital. Efforts of recent researchers have also been influenced by definitions of social capital proffered by scholars from various disciplinary backgrounds and perspectives. For example, while Portes (1998), defined social capital as ‘the ability of actors to secure benefits by virtue of membership in social networks or other social structures’, Loury (1976), espoused the view that‘...an individual’s social origin has an obvious and important effect on the amount of resources, which are ultimately invested in his development ...concept of ‘social capital’ to represent the consequences of social position in facilitating individual acquisition ...this idea has the advantage of forcing the analyst to consider the extent to which individual earnings are accounted for by social forces outside the individual’s control... (Loury, 1976: 46).Bourdieu (1986a:249) posited three categories of ‘capital including social which he defined as ‘...the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalised relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition or in other words to membership in a group which provides each of its members with the backing of the collectively-owned capital, a credential which entitles them to ‘credit’ in the various senses of the word...’ while Woolcock (1998) defined it as ‘...the social relationships that give rise to the outcomes of trust, reciprocity, and social norms, which facilitate collective action and may be of two types: community social relationships, and institutional/governmental relationships(Woolcock, 1998: 108). Central to the concept of social capital are the connections among individuals in terms of social network, reciprocity and trust that arise from them and the network and relationships represented in societies’ institutions and groups. Researchers seem to accept the view that both webs of networks and social relations (formal and/or informal) provide the context ‘social milieu’ within which social capital, though not tangible, can be built, appropriated and/or experienced in a consequential manner by an individual, or family/household and by extension, the community or State. In this sense, most studies have perceived social capital as capturing the idea of social norms, networks, trust, shared values, spiritual wellbeing, social status, prestige, honour, social identity, belonging andsocial bonding, which are considered to be significant aspects of the community's social structure and social history(Narayan, 1997, Osia, 2012). Earlier studies validated the notion thatall networks and social relations embodying social capital have a certain level of trust, which can be smaller or larger than members of the group, and which determines the extent to which people are willing to invest or divest themselves in social relationships with one another. Increased attention on formal, organizational features have led to a neglect of the unique ‘trust level’ in informal networks and kinship groups. However, the idea that high stocks of trust invariably lead to higher levels of social capital that in turn, promotes the emergence of denser social networks and progressively stronger norms of reciprocity have been validated by researchers ((Fukuyama, 1999, Serageldin & Grootaert, 2000, Serageldin, 1996). In the literature, contemporary definitions of social capital have been influenced by the works of different developers, like Loury (1976, 1981), Bourdieu (1986b), Coleman (1988, 1990) and Putnam (1993b) among others. Coleman (1990) conceived of social capital as a tool for explaining how social organisations affect the actions of individuals under the assumptions of a rational-choice theory, (following from Loury (1981). His construct of the individual-level theory of action is, which is premised on the notion that all social systems (of norms, trust, authority and THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMANITIES & SOCIAL STUDIES ISSN 2321 9203 www.theijhss.com 266 Vol 7 Issue 8 DOI No.: 10.24940/theijhss/2019/v7/i8/HS1908-075 August, 2019 exchange) arise from the interactions between individuals who engage with each other in a purposive manner to obtain those resources they lack which are of interest to them fuelled significant research interest in the analysis of ‘levels of participation in groups and associations.

Insurance and Propagation in Village Networks,"We study the dual role of networks in providing insurance and in propagating idiosyncratic shocks by using variation in the timing of severe shocks on health spending experienced by households in Thai villages. We find no impacts on food consumption. Smoothing is largely achieved through local gift and loan networks. However, insurance is partial for some households so they adjust their production decisions-drawing on their working capital, cutting input spending, and reducing labor hiring, hence propagating the shocks to other households. We find that upstream businesses close to the underinsured households in the supply chain network experience reduced local sales and increased inventories. Likewise, workers closer to the underinsured households in the labor network experience declined probability of working locally and reduced earnings. We find evidence of ex-post adjustments of these upstream households through shifting resources towards activities with lower exposure to local shocks. Our results suggest that social (village-level) gains of expanding health insurance might be higher than private (household-level) gains.",2019.0,Social Science Research Network,SSRN Electronic Journal,"Cynthia Kinnan, Krislert Samphantharak, R.

Time versus State in Insurance: Experimental Evidence from Contract Farming in Kenya,"The gains from insurance arise from the transfer of income across states. Yet, by requiring that the premium be paid up front, standard insurance products also transfer income across time. We show that this intertemporal transfer can help explain low insurance demand, especially among the poor, and in a randomized control trial in Kenya we test a crop insurance product which removes it. The product is interlinked with a contract farming scheme: as with other inputs, the buyer of the crop offers the insurance and deducts the premium from farmer revenues at harvest time. The take-up rate for pay-at-harvest insurance is 72 percent, compared to 5 percent for the standard pay-up-front contract, and the difference is largest among poorer farmers.

'Dragon Boating' Alone? Community Ties and Systemic Income Shocks,"Can social capital effectively cushion households against adverse income shocks, especially in the absence of formal insurance mechanisms in developing countries? We analyze whether participation in formal and informal community activities (our measure of social capital) helped households in Indonesia mitigating the impact of the 1998 economic crisis. We use the 1997 and 2000 rounds of the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) to capture the impact of the crisis on household welfare and assess the potency of social capital as a safety net. In contrast to previous studies, our empirical results do not lend support to this hypothesis. Using an IV strategy, we find community participation not to be statistically significant in explaining changes in household expenditure. The large magnitude and universal nature of the shock might explain why social capital did not help households. However, we find some evidence that households who participated in such activities are more likely to have received financial assistance from local authorities without necessarily being the neediest ones.",2018.0,,ERN: Financial Crises (Monetary) (Topic),"Konstantinos Matakos, D.

"When Faced with Income and Asset Shocks, Do Poor Rural Households in Vietnam Smooth Food Consumption or Assets?","Abstract Vietnamese rural households are exposed to severe covariate and idiosyncratic shocks. However, these households are remarkably resilient and have steadily increased real income and consumption over the survey period 2006 to 2012. To explain household strategies to cope with shocks we test three theoretical models: the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH), Complete Market Hypothesis (CMH), and Asset Smoothing Theory (AST). There is support for AST as households smooth productive assets rather than consumption; and for CMH as households smooth consumption against idiosyncratic, but not covariate shocks. There is no support for PIH.",2018.0,Journal of Development Studies,The Journal of Development Studies,"G. Nguyen, B.

How Much Do Existing Borrowers Value Microfinance? Evidence from an Experiment on Bundling Microcredit and Insurance,"Randomized controlled trials have found only modest effects of microfinance, but these studies focus on new clients. Existing estimates may thus understate ongoing gains for more experienced borrowers and the longer-run potential of microfinance. We estimate impacts of microfinance on experienced borrowers, using an episode when a microfinance institution modestly increased existing clients' fees in randomly selected villages (in exchange for a mandatory health insurance policy that turned out to be useless). This increase in fees led to a 22 percentage point decline in loan renewal in treatment villages (95% confidence interval: 16 to 27), compared to control villages where the policy was not introduced. Using this randomly generated variation in microfinance participation among experienced borrowers, we find impacts of microfinance that are strikingly similar to previous estimates for new clients: neither business outcomes nor household consumption were affected, on average. Also, consistent with prior studies, we find significant impacts on business outcomes among clients who had started their businesses before microfinance entered the village (0.06 standard deviation decline in an index of business outcomes from the loss of microfinance, 95% confidence interval: -0.002 to -0.12).

Ethnicity and Risk Sharing Network Formation: Evidence from Rural Vietnam,"Abstract The ethnic divide remains a persistent challenge for Vietnam. This paper explores one mechanism that could drive ethnic inequalities by analysing risk-sharing networks in rural communes. After finding substantial differences in size and composition between ethnic minority and Kinh household networks, we explore homophily patterns in link formation as drivers of these differences. In particular, we disentangle baseline homophily stemming from the different local distributions of ethnic groups from inbreeding homophily resulting from mechanisms such as ethnic-based preferences and/or biased matching processes and its effects on network structure. We find that ethnic segregation in social networks (inbreeding homophily) leads to ethnic minorities having smaller, less diversified networks than the Kinh majority. We show that inbreeding homophily is more frequent in Kinh networks than in other groups; and seems to be driven in part by segmentation of social interactions within rural communes. This pattern means that compared to other groups, Kinh could be more efficiently insured against covariant risks as they can rely on larger and more diversified risk-sharing network in terms of member occupation and location. Under this view, inequalities among ethnic groups in Vietnam appear to be partially rooted in the cultural and social distances between them.",2018.0,Journal of Development Studies,The Journal of Development Studies,"Q.

Monthly spending dynamics of the elderly following a health shock: Evidence from Singapore,"We use novel longitudinal data from 19 monthly waves of the Singapore Life Panel to examine the short-term dynamics of the effects health shocks have on household health and nonhealth spending and income by the elderly. The health shocks we study are the occurrence of new major conditions such as cancer, heart problems, and minor conditions (e.g., diabetes and hypertension). Our empirical strategy is based on an event study approach that exploits unanticipated changes in health status through the diagnosis of new health conditions. We find that major shocks have large and persistent effects whereas minor shocks have small and mainly contemporaneous effects. We find that household income reduces following a major shock for males but not females. Major health shocks lead to a decrease in households' nonhealth expenditures that is particularly pronounced for cancer and stroke sufferers, driven largely by reductions in leisure spending. The financial impact of major shocks on medical saving account balances occurs to those without private health insurance, whereas the impact is on cash balances for privately insured individuals.",2018.0,Health Economics,Health Economics,"T.

Changes in Social Network Structure in Response to Exposure to Formal Credit Markets,"
 We show that the entry of formal financial institutions can have far-reaching and long-lasting impacts on informal lending and social networks more generally. We first study the introduction of microfinance in 75 villages in Karnataka, India, 43 of which were exposed to microfinance. Using difference-in-differences, we show that networks shrank more in exposed villages. Moreover, links between households that were both unlikely to borrow from microfinance were at least as likely to disappear as links involving likely borrowers. We replicate these surprising findings in the context of a RCT in Hyderabad, where a microfinance institution randomly selected 52 of 104 neighborhoods to enter first. Four years after all neighborhoods were treated, households in early-entry neighborhoods had had credit access longer and had larger loans. We again find fewer social relationships between households in these neighborhoods, even among those ex-ante unlikely to borrow. Because the results suggest global spillovers, atypical in usual models of network formation, we develop a new dynamic model of network formation that emphasizes chance meetings, where efforts to socialize generate a global network-level externality. Finally, we analyze informal borrowing and the sensitivity of consumption to income fluctuations. Households unlikely to take up microcredit suffer the greatest loss of informal borrowing and risk sharing, underscoring the global nature of the externality.",2018.0,Social Science Research Network,ERPN: Social Entrepreneurial Activities/Behavior (Topic),"A.

Heterogeneous Households Under Uncertainty,"I characterize a dynamic economy under general distributions of households’ risk tolerance, endowments, and beliefs about long-term growth. As the economy expands and the stock market rises (a) the fraction of households with declining consumption-share increases; (b) the wealth-share of high risk-tolerant households increases; (c) richer households’ wealth display a higher CAPM beta; and (d) households’ portfolios change qualitatively. A log-utility investor for instance borrows in contractions but lends in expansions. Variations in uncertainty and expected growth generate trading volume due to risk sharing.

Using detailed social networks data, randomized incentives to purchase the insurance product, and hypothetical informal transfer data that mirror the existing customary arrangements, we find respondents' own formal insurance uptake has no significant effect on their willingness to share risk through customary institutions. We also find weak evidence that a randomly matched peer's insurance uptake positively influences respondents' willingness to make informal transfers to that match.

Effect of informal financial support for health care on health Insurance uptake: Evidence from a mixed‐methods study in Tamale metropolis of northern Ghana,"Attempts to study the determinants of health insurance enrollment in resource-poor settings have often given less consideration to the potential influence of informal risk-sharing systems on individuals and households' decisions about health insurance. This paper contributes to existing discussions in this area by examining the effect of informal financial support for health care, an example of informal risk-sharing arrangement, on enrollment in the Ghana National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). It is based on a mixed-methods research in Tamale metropolis of northern Ghana. The study found widespread availability and reliance on informal support among low-income households to finance out-of-pocket health-care expenditure. Informal financial support for enrollment into the NHIS was noted to be less available. The study further found less strong but suggestive evidence that the perceived availability of informal financial support for health care by individuals diminishes their enrollment in the NHIS.

Peer Effects in Consumption in India: An Instrumental Variables Approach Using Negative Idiosyncratic Shocks,"Abstract This paper examines peer effects in consumption in context of a less developed country. Specifically, the question that I seek to answer is whether consumption expenditure of a household is influenced by that of its peers in a less developed country. To examine this question, I use newly available household level data from India. I define a household’s peer group as other households living in its village/neighborhood. In assessing the influences of peers in this context, there are two key empirical challenges including shared group-level unobservables, and simultaneity of peer influences. I address these issues by using an instrumental variables/fixed effects approach that compares households in the same district but different villages/neighborhoods who are thus exposed to different sets of peers. In particular, I use plausibly exogenous variation in idiosyncratic expenditure shocks – which are accidental and negative in nature – faced by peers as instruments for peers’ consumption expenditure. Preferred specification suggests that a one standard deviation increase in average consumption expenditure of a household’s peers causes the household’s own consumption expenditure to increase by 0.42 standard deviations. Falsification tests and robustness checks support the validity of my results. My findings suggest that policies that influence a household’s consumption will also affect the consumption of the household’s peers through social interactions. This implies traditional analyses of consumption intervention programs that do not take into account such spillover effects will understate the total social impact of the programs, and hence lead to inaccurate evaluation of cost-effectiveness of such programs.",2018.0,World Development,Econometric Modeling: Microeconometric Models of Household Behavior eJournal,Punarjit Roychowdhury,10.2139/ssrn.3200841,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d380eb559eefd08a657a43800cf02e0a01a3270e,80.0,23.0,4.0,['Economics'],"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/preview/3334514/peer%20effects%20in%20consumption%20in%20india.pdf,,2018-06-22,True,True
The economic value of social capital,"
Purpose
Empirical studies on the importance of social capital for poor households show divergent outcomes. This divergence may stem from the lack of a conceptual framework for capturing the social capital dimensions that deliver economic value to individuals. The purpose of this paper is to define individual social capital from an economic perspective and propose a measurement based on two dimensions of individual social capital that bring economic value to individuals, i.e. informal risk insurance arrangements and information advantages arising from personal social networks.


Design/methodology/approach
The authors first provide a concrete definition of individual social capital and identifying social capital dimensions that are important from an economic perspective (i.e. dimensions that bring economic value to the individual). Next, the authors develop a new conceptual framework around this definition and propose a social capital measurement. Finally, the authors apply this measurement numerically to demonstrate that differences in the network configurations between individuals lead to asymmetry of social interactions between these individuals.


Findings
The authors show that the exchange of resources between two individuals is affected by their individual network configurations. In particular, the authors show that differing network configurations drive asymmetrical social interaction between individuals.


Originality/value
The approach may be especially relevant for understanding of the persistence of poverty and inequality in developing economies. These economies are characterized by environments in which imperfect information, underdeveloped or non-existent formal institutions and limited contract enforcement abound and where social capital may therefore be important to facilitate economic transactions. In particular, the authors see clear applications of the approach in better understanding and improving the use of microfinance programs.

Labour market and intra-household dynamics in urban Tanzania,"While a large body of literature documents the existence of informal arrangements to share risk across and within households, there has been little research on the various coping strategies through which risk sharing takes place, and how these strategies function. This study attempts to fill this gap in the literature and examine whether, and to what extent, individual labour-supply behaviour is one of such coping strategies used by households facing risk. Our hypothesis is that, as with a small business, individuals adjust their employment behaviour in the event that one of their household members experiences a variation in their labour supply, that is, either gains or loses a job. Using a unique dataset that collects employment histories for each family member in Tanzania, our results confirm our hypothesis and show that the labour supply of the household members is an important determinant of employment transitions, and that these effects are greater for women than for men. In the context of low-income countries, we interpret these findings as evidence that the household works as a risk-sharing institution built around women’s labour supply.",2018.0,,African Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics,"Sarah Bridges, A.

Expenditures on social schemes are large, but their effectiveness and ability to act as safety nets against shocks can be limited. This paper devises a tractable empirical framework to explore several hypotheses in social protection schemes in Niger. The analyses document two important results. First, non-poverty status and household consumption expenditures decline remarkably when exposed to extreme shocks, that is, declines between 31 and 48 percentage points and 24,278 and 47,549 CFA, respectively. In response, affected households employ a vector of strategies to deal with realized shocks, ranging from the use of livestock holdings to doing nothing. There is evidence of substitution across the shock-strategy set over time. Engaging in migration as a coping mechanism leads to worse household outcomes. This result can be explained by theories of asymmetric information between migrants and their families, and unfavorable labor market conditions at migrants' destination. Second, social transfers are crucial only in the second quarter of the calendar year. Social assistance provided within the second quarter appear to be effective on average and significantly dampens the impact of shocks on households' consumption and vulnerability. The paper interprets this finding as evidence against the long-standing incentive-hypothesis that providing social assistance is a disincentive for households to engage in possible coping strategies, and makes them more sensitive to external shocks for behavioral reasons. The results have important implications for the design and delivery of social assistance programs.",2018.0,,,"Francis Annan, Aly Sanoh",10.1596/1813-9450-8455,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e7448f9568b09a8030399c3d22a6a49767ce8c8e,125.0,7.0,0.0,['Economics'],"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstreams/298843a3-8401-5c0c-8ec3-5aa9ed78dcc5/download,,2018-05-29,True,True
Benefits and costs of risk insurance in selected countries of Asia,"Several risk insurance initiatives have been implemented at the grassroots level for reducing the vulnerability of communities to natural disasters. Despite these efforts, the penetration of risk insurance in developing Asia is poor compared to many developed countries due to several barriers that this sector is facing and the cost of insurance premiums is an important one. Against this background, this study aimed to assess the benefits and costs accrued through community-level risk insurance experiences in the Asia region, evaluate barriers limiting its penetration, and identify interventions for greater risk insurance penetration leading to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. The benefit-cost analysis presented in this paper was based on household surveys conducted in three countries including India, Malaysia and the Philippines. The study has indicated several benefits accrued from risk insurance in the case study countries and a positive benefit-cost ratio. The net positive benefit-cost ratios provide an impetus to promote risk insurance by governments and an important evidence for potential subscribers to consider investing in insurance. Subsidized premiums played an important role in the positive benefit-cost ratios, which helped them in enrolling and in continuing in the insurance schemes. Shortterm risk reduction benefits were seen including the avoidance of distress sale of assets and continuation of normal life aftermath of the disasters. However, the impact of risk insurance on long-term risk reduction and in terms of related investments by the insured could not be well supported by our findings.

Will Urban Migrants Formally Insure Their Rural Relatives? Family Networks and Rainfall Index Insurance in Burkina Faso,"We present findings from a pilot study exploring whether and how existing ties between urban migrants and rural farmers may be used to provide the latter improved access to formal insurance. Urban migrants in Ouagadougou (the capital of Burkina Faso) originating from nearby villages were offered, at the prevailing market price, a rainfall index insurance product that can potentially protect their rural relatives from adverse weather shocks. The product had an uptake of 22% during the two-week subscription window. Uptake rates were higher by 17-22 ppts among urban migrants who were randomly offered an insurance policy that would make pay-outs directly to the intended beneficiary rather than the subscriber. We argue that rainfall index insurance can complement informal risk-sharing networks by mitigating problems of informational asymmetry and self-control issues.",2018.0,World Development,Urban Economics & Regional Studies eJournal,"H.

Social Security and Fighting Poverty in Tunisia,"The objective of this study was to examine the role of social security in fighting poverty in Metlaoui, Tunisia, using survey data collected between July 2012 and January 2014, covering 200 poor households. We used questionnaire data, which gave a thorough analysis of the reactions, behavior, and strategies adopted by poor households as a result of various forms of risk. Social security has an effect on a number of different areas, including health, education, housing, and income. Our methodology explored both complete and partial risk-sharing, to investigate the impact of social security schemes on the strategies adopted by households to cope with economic shocks. The estimation results of different models showed that social security could help social security-covered households choose less costly strategies to cope with risks. However, the role of social security remains insufficient, given that covered households had less confidence in its services and they adopted strategies of self-insurance or income smoothing. Overall, the results showed that social security plays an important role in Metlaoui, but it remains insufficient, especially for households that are not covered by social security and are suffering from heavy health expenditures.",2018.0,,Economies,"Hasna Khemili, Mounir Belloumi",10.3390/ECONOMIES6010012,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3718b3091778848224d4af675cd460b9c29b92f9,31.0,6.0,0.0,['Economics'],"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Sociology', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Political Science', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7099/6/1/12/pdf?version=1519020682,['Review'],2018-02-19,True,True
Heterogeneous Preferences and Risk Sharing at Household Level in China,"This paper investigates the degree of risk sharing across households in China with heterogeneous risk and time preferences from the late 1990s to early 2010s. Standard tests assume homogeneous preferences across households, which may bias the true risk sharing degree if, in reality, preferences correlate with variations of household income. We use household data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) and China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) to show that, in China, the incomes of less risk-averse and less patient households correlate more positively with the aggregate risk. The standard test, which ignores this correlation, shows about 30% of household income shocks pass through to household consumption. However, this number reduces to 3% and becomes insignificant when preferences heterogeneity is accounted for. By comparing this result with that of the US, we find the degree of risk sharing across households in China is similar to that in the US. We argue that this improvement of risk sharing from the standard test to tests with preferences heterogeneity is due to the institutional changes and labour market reforms that took place during the mid-1990s and early 2000s. This gave individuals more freedom in their labour market choices, which makes preferences heterogeneity more relevant, as people can choose occupations more aligned with their preferences. We then use the Research Center on the Rural Economy (RCRE) Fixed Point Rural Household Survey data to provide empirical evidence of the effect of reforms on household risk sharing.",2018.0,,ERN: Urban & Rural Analysis in Developing Economies (Topic),"Jennifer T.

"Comparative Analysis of Non-medical Consumption Pattern between Insured and Uninsured People in Ekiti State, Nigeria","Health Insurance (HI) brings about welfare improvement through improved health status and maintenance of non-medical consumption by ensuring that medical expenditures are smoothened over time. Notwithstanding, available data show that less than 4% of the Nigerian households are covered by national health insurance scheme.This implies weak ability to smoothen consumption over time whenever there is ailment. This paper aims at studying and evaluating the spillover effect of health insurance on non-medical consumption in Ekiti state. A propensity score matching estimation model was adopted to 1500 households across Ekiti state. This is the mean effect of an intervention through the mean difference in the outcomes of the treated and the control groups. The mean expenditure on non-medical consumption was N6947.03. In addition to that, the sign of the coefficient of the effect of health insurance on non-medical consumption is positive, showing that health insurance increases expenditure of insured households on non-medical consumption. Having recognized that insured households can be financially protected against unforeseen medical bill, federal government should encourage the expansion of health insurance by encouraging state government, local government and private sector to enroll their employees in health insurance programme. The paper concludes that health insurance is consumption increasing and therefore be expended to more people at local government areas to further redistribute income from the healthy to the sick.",2017.0,,,"Francis O.

"Income shocks, informal insurance mechanisms, and household consumption expenditure: Micro-evidence from Nigeria","Purpose




The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of income shocks on household real consumption expenditure, taking into account the various informal coping strategies adopted by the households. Using Nigerian Household Panel Survey data for the year 2010/2011 and 2012/2013 respectively, and probit model estimation approach, the results suggest that idiosyncratic shocks have effect on household consumption expenditure and the informal insurance strategies play only limited roles in providing the needed insurance to households in the face of shocks. Also, the effect of shocks vary according to households characteristics, which depends on whether the household is headed by male or female and urban or rural dweller.




Design/methodology/approach




This paper explores the fixed effects and probit model estimation approach to examine the relationship between the effect of covariate and self-reported idiosyncratic shocks on household welfare. The study examines the effectiveness of the various informal coping measures adopted by households against shocks.




Findings




The results suggest that idiosyncratic shocks have been found to have little effect on real consumption expenditure and the informal insurance strategies play only limited roles in providing the much needed insurance to households in the face of shocks. Also, the effect of shocks vary according to households characteristics, whether the household is headed by male or female and urban or rural dweller is important.

The Role of Savings and Credit in Coping with Idiosyncratic Household Shocks,"Abstract This study examines the effect of access to formal banking services on households’ ability to smooth consumption in response to illness of adult workers. The institutional peculiarities of Indonesia’s largest commercial bank are exploited to separately estimate the effects of access to formal credit from savings. The means by which households smooth consumption differs depending on their access to formal services. Those with access to formal credit increase borrowing from banks, while those with access only to formal savings, but not credit, draw down on savings. Households without access to formal banking services end up liquidating productive assets.",2017.0,,The Journal of Development Studies,"Stephen B.

Idiosyncratic Shocks and Child Labor: Does Gender Matter? Evidence from Indonesia,"This paper aims to analyze the effect of various idiosyncratic shocks against child labor, working hours of children and school participation based on gender. Also, the role of the assets held by households as one of the coping strategies to mitigate the effects of such shocks. The results of random effect probit technique show that girls are more vulnerable and unprotected in the event of idiosyncratic shocks, especially those shocks caused by crop loss and the decline in household income due to price and quantity. Meanwhile, idiosyncratic shock that drives the existence of boys child labor is the death of the head or members of the household.. Additionally, household assets play an important role in reducing the number of child labor and increase school participation but do not affect the working hours of children during a variety of idiosyncratic shocks",2017.0,,Jurnal Ekonomi Pembangunan: Kajian Masalah Ekonomi dan Pembangunan,Bayu Kharisma,10.23917/jep.v18i1.2907,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63319ac4fc9343deaf4eed6154d898bf99a06100,29.0,0.0,0.0,['Economics'],"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,http://journals.ums.ac.id/index.php/JEP/article/download/2907/3170,,2017-07-31,True,True
"Age of Marriage, Weather Shocks, and the Direction of Marriage Payments","We study how aggregate economic conditions affect the timing of marriage, and particularly child marriage, in Sub‐Saharan Africa and in India. In both regions, substantial monetary or in‐kind transfers occur with marriage: bride price across Sub‐Saharan Africa and dowry in India. In a simple equilibrium model of the marriage market in which parents choose when their children marry, income shocks affect the age of marriage because marriage payments are a source of consumption smoothing, particularly for a woman's family. As predicted by our model, we show that droughts, which reduce annual crop yields by 10 to 15% and aggregate income by 4 to 5%, have opposite effects on the marriage behavior of a sample of 400,000 women in the two regions: in Sub‐Saharan Africa they increase the annual hazard into child marriage by 3%, while in India droughts reduce such a hazard by 4%. Changes in the age of marriage due to droughts are associated with changes in fertility, especially in Sub‐Saharan Africa, and with declines in observed marriage payments. Our results indicate that the age of marriage responds to short‐term changes in aggregate economic conditions and that marriage payments determine the sign of this response. This suggests that, in order to design successful policies to combat child marriage and improve investments in daughters' human capital, it is crucial to understand the economic role of marriage market institutions.",2017.0,Econometrica,AARN: Human Ecology & Behavioral Ecology (Topic),"L.

Smooth Operator: Remittances and Fiscal Shocks,"With 250 million migrants globally, remittances are one of the major sources of income in many developing countries. While there is abundant evidence that remittances facilitate consumption smoothing in receving countries, the literature has not considered whether this effect varies with the fiscal stance and during fiscal shocks. Therefore, we investigate the impact of remittances on the stability of household consumption, using both cross-country and household-level datasets. Our focus is on whether the consumption-smoothing effect changes with fiscal policy phases and whether remittances and government support are substitutes or complements in stabilizing household consumption. We find that remittances help smooth consumption, and hence improve welfare, more during fiscal consolidation episodes, while this impact is insignificant during fiscal expansions. The results also indicate that the effect is more pronounced in countries with greater reliance on remittances.",2017.0,Social Science Research Network,Macroeconomics: Consumption,"K.

An Empirical Analysis of Health Shocks and Informal Risk Sharing Networks,"Using panel household survey data from rural Ethiopia, we investigate informal risk sharing against health shocks in the presence of multiple risk sharing networks. We find that neither short‐term nor long‐term health shocks are insured through transfers from networks such as friends, neighbors, and members of informal associations. However, networks related along bloodline such as extended family members provide assistance when health shocks are long‐term such as disabilities. The results show that these networks strategically complement planned component of their transfers which are made on a regular basis such as remittance, entitlement, or chop money (small cash sums for household expenses). Moreover, we find significant history dependence in transfers from not only genetically distant networks but also extended family members as well as formal institutions, which seems to discourage dependency.

Also, the role of the assets held by households as one of the coping strategies to mitigate the effects of shocks.

This indicates that households are not sheltered from the idiosyncratic shocks and restricted access to formal and informal institutions.

Consumption Vulnerability to Prolonged Illness,"Despite its significance in household welfare, little is known about the capacity of intrahousehold risk sharing arrangements to insure consumption against major health shocks. Using rich health data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey, this study finds no evidence of full insurance against adult morbidity in rural Indonesia. In particular, the results show sizable and significant effects of adult morbidity on food consumption. They imply that, despite the recent health sector reforms of Indonesia, the health insurance system is not effective in shielding agricultural households against some severe and long lasting health shocks.

Consumption and Investment in Resource Pooling Family Networks,"This paper examines a novel motive for resource pooling in family networks in rural economies: to relax credit constraints and facilitate investment in non-collateralizeable assets for which credit market imperfections are most binding. We thus complement established literature examining risk-sharing motives for resource transfers within family networks, as well as motives based on kinship tax obligations. We do so exploiting the Progresa program data, in which family networks can be identified, households are subject to large exogenous resource inflows, and detailed responses on consumption and an array of investments can be tracked in a household panel over five years. We find that for every dollar that accrues to the family network through Progresa transfers, food consumption expenditures increase by around 65c for both households eligible for Progresa and ineligible members of the same family network. Hence the marginal propensity of families to invest/save out of every dollar is around .35, and we document how this is channeled towards easing credit constraints poorer network members face in financing non-collateralizable investments into their children's human capital. We show these consumption and investment benefits of being embedded within a family network are sustained five years after households first experience resource transfers from Progresa. Hence the interplay between resource inflows and resource pooling by family networks can place network members on sustained paths out of poverty.",2017.0,,Macroeconomics: Production & Investment eJournal,"M.

Safety net for agriculture: effect of idiosyncratic income shock on remittance payments,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of illness-driven agriculture income shocks on remittance payments in Ghana using a nationally representative household pseudo-panel data set for 1991/1992, 1998/1999 and 2005/2006. Design/methodology/approach - The two-stage least square instrumental variable technique is used. This is compared with the ordinary least squares estimator. Findings - The author finds that households in Ghana use remittances to protect themselves from negative agriculture income shocks. The study further reveals that the protection is resilient in female-headed households. Research limitations/implications - The question of remittances as a safety net mechanism is interesting, but the limitation is the challenges involving the counterfactual setup in studying the effects of endogenous migration choices. Practical implications - The study provides that, as far as microeconomic factors are concerned, remittances increase in times of negative agriculture income shocks attributed to illness in Ghana. Social implications - The finding points to the fact that remittance payments play an essential role as an informal safety net during illness-driven agriculture income shock especially for female-headed households in Ghana. This has an important implication for poverty reduction in Ghana. Originality/value - It provides an empirical test of the claim that remittance flows buffer idiosyncratic shock with micro-level household data that incorporates both internal and international remittances. The paper introduces gender dimension into idiosyncratic shocks’ impact. Also, the data set makes it possible to provide a reliable set of agriculture income shock estimates.",2017.0,,International Journal of Social Economics,Eric Akobeng,10.1108/IJSE-12-2014-0271,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c95a4039ca71807f6b4bf7e9f179749032ced394,53.0,4.0,0.0,['Economics'],"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",False,,,2017-01-09,True,True

The Vulnerable Are Not (Necessarily) the Poor,"In this paper I examine the concept of ""vulnerability"" within the context of income mobility of the poor. While the concept of poverty is well developed, the concept of vulnerability is less established in the economic literature. I test for the dynamics of vulnerable households in the UK using Waves 1 - 12 of the British Household Panel Survey and find that, of three different types of risks for which I test, household-specific shocks and economy-wide aggregate shocks have the greatest impact on consumption, in comparison to shocks to the income stream. I find vulnerable households up to at least 10 percentile points above the poverty line.

Endogenous Partial Insurance and Inequality,"
 In this paper, we propose a model of endogenous partial insurance and we investigate its implications for macroeconomic outcomes, such as wealth inequality, asset accumulation, interest rate, and consumption smoothing. To this end, we include participation costs to state-contingent asset markets into an otherwise standard Aiyagari (1994) model. We highlight the resulting nonmonotonic relationship between wealth and insurance-market participation when insurance is costly. Poor households remain uninsured, middle-class households participate in the insurance market, whereas rich households decide to self-insure by only purchasing risk-free assets. After theoretically characterizing the endogenous partial insurance equilibrium, we quantify its effect, emphasizing the roles of a participation channel and an interest rate channel.",2016.0,Journal of the European Economic Association,HEC Paris Research Paper Series,"Eric Mengus, Roberto Pancrazi",10.2139/ssrn.2662437,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5fca99fa25dc5c346ad56a0563b6ce68db4dbe89,88.0,2.0,0.0,['Economics'],"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/114928/1/WRAP-endogenous-partial-insurance-inequality-Pancrazi-2019.pdf,,2016-10-27,True,True
Spillovers of Community-Based Health Interventions on Consumption Smoothing,"Community-based group interventions are a cost-effective way of delivering programs in low-income settings. Design features may influence behaviors beyond those targeted by the intervention. This paper studies spillover effects of a participatory community health intervention in rural Malawi, implemented through a cluster randomized control trial, on an untargeted outcome: consumption smoothing after crop losses. While crop losses reduce consumption growth in the absence of the intervention, households in treated areas compensate for this loss and perfectly insure their consumption. We rule out better self-insurance and labor supply adjustments as drivers, indicating that informal risk sharing must have improved. Suggestive evidence shows that health improvements cannot explain the whole effect and that instead social interactions, which may have alleviated contracting frictions, had a role to play.",2016.0,Economic development and cultural change,Economic Development and Cultural Change,"B.

Rather, the study postulates that other risks facing smallholders and their risk responses disposition may distort and override farmers’ attitude towards weather index insurance. Further, results of the Ordered Probit model revealed that Sex of the household head, size of the household, if a farmer experienced crop loss in the previous farming seasons, off-farm income, if a farmer received compensation, the level of education of the household head, if the household head accessed Credit and group membership had a significant influence on the perception of the smallholders towards the index-based micro insurance scheme.",2016.0,,International Journal of Food and Agricultural Economics,"H.

The Costs of Consumption Smoothing: Less Schooling and Less Nutrition,"Using novel microdata, we explore lifecycle consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa. We find that households' ability to smooth consumption over the lifecycle is large, particularly, in rural areas. Consumption in old age is sustained by shifting to self-farmed staple food, as opposed to traditional savings mechanisms or food gifts. This smoothing strategy indicates two important costs. The first cost is a loss of human capital as children seem to be diverted away from school and into producing self-farmed food. Second, a diet largely concentrated in staple food (e.g., maize in Malawi) in old age results in a loss of nutritional quality for households headed by the elderly.",2016.0,Journal of Demographic Economics,ERN: Urban & Rural Analysis in Developing Economies (Topic),"Leandro De Magalhães, Dongya Koh, Raül Santaeulàlia-Llopis",10.2139/ssrn.2837190,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f03b8b51bfed54a3c2ef0b35ecbb033b4f273d76,74.0,6.0,0.0,['Economics'],"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/files/192649945/LifecycleConsExpSSA_JODE_last.pdf,,2016-09-01,True,True
"Migration, marital arrangements and consumption smoothing among Burkinab farm households","Risk coping is a severe challenge for households in developing countries, particularly for farm household because income is stochastically variable and credit markets are incomplete. Because of lack of formal systems to cope with risk, households rely on informal arrangements such as migration and marriage. This paper contributes to the literature of risk-coping strategies by examining how migration and marital arrangements serve to mitigate income risk and facilitate consumption smoothing in rural Burkina Faso, a low-income country characterized by rainfall variability in conjunction with very low income levels and a pressing need for consumption-insurance. The findings suggest that households cannot smooth consumption via assets transactions because markets work imperfectly.

The Price of Growth: Consumption Insurance in China 1989-2009,"We construct a panel data of income and consumption of Chinese households from 1989 to 2009 from the publicly available China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). We use the Nutrition Survey from the CHNS, that has a detailed account of the dietary information at the household level, to construct a value of diet. We show that the annual value of diet, net the value of food coupons, the value of home grown food and the value of food gifts a household received over a year, matches the aggregate statistics of household expenditure on food closely by province, urban status and year. With this measure of food consumption as the major non-durable consumption component, we are able to capture 60% to 70% of the typical household consumption basket in China. Together with the income measures surveyed in the CHNS, we form a panel and estimate a partial insurance model from the panel. Our estimation results suggest that the rural and urban households in China face very different income processes; the urban households can better insure against the permanent income shocks while the rural households do better at the transitory income shocks. Over the twenty years' period, the less educated urban households suffered most notably a worsening of the ability to insure against income risks.",2016.0,American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics,ERN: Other Development Economics: Microeconomic Issues in Developing Economies (Topic),"Raül Santaeulàlia-Llopis, Yu Zheng",10.2139/ssrn.2511587,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b20a6d2bd07f84e83ce1fb3fda237045daa20fcf,117.0,41.0,1.0,['Economics'],"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/1814/43944/1/ECO_2016_13.pdf,,2016-08-09,True,True
"Indirect Reciprocity, Resource Sharing, and Environmental Risk: Evidence from Field Experiments in Siberia","Integrating information from existing research, qualitative ethnographic interviews, and participant observation, we designed a field experiment that introduces idiosyncratic environmental risk and a voluntary sharing decision into a standard public goods game. Conducted with subsistence resource users in rural villages on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Northeast Siberia, we find evidence consistent with a model of indirect reciprocity and local social norms of helping the needy. When participants are allowed to develop reputations in the experiments, as is the case in most small-scale societies, we find that sharing is increasingly directed toward individuals experiencing hardship, good reputations increase aid, and the pooling of resources through voluntary sharing becomes more effective. We also find high levels of voluntary sharing without a strong commitment device; however, this form of cooperation does not increase contributions to the public good. Our results are consistent with previous experiments and theoretical models, suggesting strategic risks tied to rewards, punishments, and reputations are important. However, unlike studies that focus solely on strategic risks, we find the effects of rewards, punishments, and reputations are altered by the presence of environmental factors. Unexpected changes in resource abundance increase interdependence and may alter the costs and benefits of cooperation, relative to defection. We suggest environmental factors that increase interdependence are critically important to consider when developing and testing theories of cooperation",2016.0,PLoS ONE,PLoS ONE,"E. L. Howe, James J.

THE SHORT-TERM IMPACT OF UNCONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFERS TO THE POOR: EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FROM KENYA.,"We use a randomized controlled trial to study the response of poor households in rural Kenya to unconditional cash transfers from the NGO GiveDirectly. The transfers differ from other programs in that they are explicitly unconditional, large, and concentrated in time. We randomized at both the village and household levels; furthermore, within the treatment group, we randomized recipient gender (wife versus husband), transfer timing (lump-sum transfer versus monthly installments), and transfer magnitude (US$404 PPP versus US$1,525 PPP). We find a strong consumption response to transfers, with an increase in household monthly consumption from $158 PPP to $193 PPP nine months after the transfer began. Transfer recipients experience large increases in psychological well-being. We find no overall effect on levels of the stress hormone cortisol, although there are differences across some subgroups. Monthly transfers are more likely than lump-sum transfers to improve food security, whereas lump-sum transfers are more likely to be spent on durables, suggesting that households face savings and credit constraints. Together, these results suggest that unconditional cash transfers have significant impacts on economic outcomes and psychological well-being.",2016.0,Quarterly Journal of Economics,The quarterly journal of economics,"J.

Incentive for risk sharing and trust formation: experimental and survey evidence from Bangladesh,"Using data from a unique household survey and an artefactual field experiment conducted in rural Bangladesh, this study evaluates the impact on trust in community members of an incentive to maintain a risk-sharing arrangement between villagers. Risk sharing is a major opportunity for cooperation in rural economies, and the experience of cooperation could facilitate trust. In order to test this hypothesis, this study characterizes the incentive for risk sharing by the patterns of exogenous income shocks in the real world and risk preference, and trust in community members is elicited experimentally. The empirical results from dyadic regression demonstrate that villagers connected by a stronger incentive form higher level of trust. It is also found that villagers are more likely to share risks in villages that have stronger incentives. These findings suggest that the introduction of formal insurance, which reduces the incentive of risk sharing, could break down trust.",2016.0,Oxford Economic Papers,Oxford Economic Papers,M.

Vulnerability and household welfare in Vietnam,"This thesis contains three studies which provide a complete set of vulnerability assessments in Vietnam. The first study in the thesis estimates the extent of vulnerability and analyses who the vulnerable are. In addition, this study investigates the link between dynamic poverty and vulnerability, something which has rarely been done. To do this, the most common definition of vulnerability as ‘Vulnerability as Expected Poverty’ (VEP) is used, along with a data set extracted from three consecutive surveys from 2002 to 2006. The results reveal that, (i) vulnerability estimated using the reference line is more appropriate than when estimated using the actual poverty line for poverty prediction in the case of Vietnam; (ii) ex ante vulnerability in previous periods might translate to ex post poverty in the following periods though both vulnerability and the incidence of poverty tend to fall over time; (iii) the vulnerability of the poor may trap them in poverty; and (iv) the vulnerability of the non-poor could propel them into poverty. The second study investigates sources of household vulnerability and responses to risks in rural Vietnam using data from Vietnam Access to Resources Household Surveys (VARHS). Vulnerability as low utility measure (VEU) is employed to estimate and distinguish the sources of vulnerability. Next the household’s behavior to cope with shocks is analyzed; and finally the effectiveness of the insurance mechanism is evaluated. The main findings are that: (i) the utility of the average household is 71 per cent less than the hypothetical situation without any risk or inequality in consumption, and idiosyncratic shocks contribute 50 per cent of the loss; (ii) households depend heavily on informal coping strategies such as food consumption reduction, savings withdrawal, taking children out of school, or capital depletion. The opportunity to borrow money from formal institutions is limited, while subsidies from the government or NGOs are available only in cases of natural disaster; and (iii) household consumption and income exhibit highly correlated variation, implying that existing informal insurance instruments are less effective than expected. The third study provides new evidence on the impact of health insurance coverage on household vulnerability using Vietnam Access to Resources Household Surveys (VARHS) undertaken during 2010-2012. The outcomes of interest are the probability of falling into poverty (VEP) and the magnitude of utility loss (VEU).

Seasonal Scarcity and Sharing Norms,"Sharing provides one of few sources of insurance in poor communities. It gains prominence during adverse shocks, often largely aggregate, when it is also costliest for individuals to share. Yet it is little understood how scarcity affects individual willingness to share and willingness to enforce sharing from others, an important ingredient in sustaining prosocial behavior. This is what this paper examines. I conduct repeated within-subject lab-in-the-field experiments among Afghan subsistence farmers during a lean and a postharvest season of relative plenty. These farmers experience seasonal scarcities annually. Using dictator and third party punishment games I separate individual sharing behavior from enforcement of sharing norms. While sharing exhibits high degree of temporal stability at both the aggregate, and, to a large extent, at the individual level, the enforcement of sharing norms is substantially weaker during the lean season. The findings suggest that the farmers are capable of sustaining mutual sharing through transitory periods of scarcity. It remains an open question whether exposure to unexpected shocks or prolonged periods of scarcity might result in breakdown of prosociality due to loosened sharing norms enforcement on a community level.",2016.0,Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization,Agricultural & Natural Resource Economics eJournal,Vojtěch Bartoš,10.2139/ssrn.2732964,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/82b002e0db2760372d5b85a45380b443db01e799,157.0,22.0,0.0,"['Business', 'Economics']","[{'category': 'Business', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,http://www.cerge-ei.cz/pdf/wp/Wp557.pdf,,2016-02-01,True,True
Homophily as a Safety Net: Investigating When Smallholder Farmers Decide to Buy Hybrid Seed in Northern Ghana,"Dynamic social relationships can enhance farmer adoption or lead to the rejection of modern seed varieties. Different social pathways provide farmers with information about traditional and commercial seeds. Identifying how social relationships facilitate different varietal use may reveal the informal safety nets indigenous farmers rely on when transitioning to modern varieties. While homophilous relationships have been observed to stifle farmers’ adoption of agricultural innovations, these bonded social relationships are the basis for informal seed exchange. Through homophilous relationships, farmers are able to communicate pertinent risks and foster greater support systems. By examining two communities in Northern Ghana, this study tests whether homophilous relationships function as safety nets that prevent farmers from using modern seed or if they mitigate risks of agrobiodiversity decline. Through social network analysis, particular relationships were observed to act as necessary safety nets for farmers’ adoption of commercial seed; whom farmers commonly interact with may protect indigenous groups from adverse risk.",2015.0,,,Vincent Ricciardi,10.18113/P8IK159741,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b4dfcaa6851940e4ec0f203b11c6398fda4a475f,73.0,1.0,1.0,['Business'],"[{'category': 'Business', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Agricultural and Food Sciences', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Sociology', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",False,,,2015-12-07,True,True
Social protection in the face of climate change: targeting principles and financing mechanisms,"Abstract This paper builds a multi-generation household model of consumption, accumulation, and risk management to assess the dynamic consequences of climate risk exposure. The model incorporates long-term impacts of consumption shortfalls, induced by optimal ‘asset smoothing’ coping behavior of the vulnerable, on poverty. The analysis shows the long-term level and depth of poverty can be improved by incorporating ‘vulnerability-targeted social protection’ into a conventional social protection system. The paper further shows insurance-based vulnerability-targeted social protection dominates (in economic growth and poverty reduction measures) both in-kind transfers and asset-based vulnerability-targeted protection. We then stress test social protection mechanisms and find the relative performance of insurance-based vulnerability-targeted social protection improves when subjected to current pessimistic projections about increasing drought risk. However, if drought risk increases beyond current climate change projections, then even the vulnerability-targeted policy loses its ability to stabilize the extent and depth of poverty.",2015.0,Environment and Development Economics,Environment and Development Economics,"M.

Group Size and the Efficiency of Informal Risk Sharing,"The objective of this paper is to understand and test empirically the relationship between group size and informal risk sharing. Models of informal risk sharing with limited commitment and grim-trigger punishments upon deviation imply that larger groups provide better informal insurance. However, when subgroups of households can credibly deviate, so that sustainable informal arrangements ought to be coalition-proof, the relationship between group size and the amount of insurance is unclear. Building on the framework of Genicot and Ray (2003), we show that this relationship is theoretically ambiguous. We then investigate it empirically using data on the size of the sibships of the household head and spouse in rural Malawi. To identify the relevant potential group within which risk is shared, we exploit a social norm among the main ethnic group in our sample which is such that the brothers of the wife should play a key role in ensuring her household’s wellbeing. We ?nd that households in which the wife has many brothers are not well-insured against crop loss events. Importantly, we fail to uncover a similar relationship for the sisters of the wife, ruling out that our ?ndings are driven by wives with many siblings (e.g. brothers) having poorer extended family networks. Calibrating our theoretical framework using values similar to those in our sample produces a relationship between household risk sharing and group size that is similar to that uncovered in the data, indicating that the threat of coalitional deviations can explain our empirical ?ndings.",2015.0,,Development Economics: Regional & Country Studies eJournal,"E.

Consumption Smoothing and the Welfare Cost of Uncertainty,"When agents are unable to smooth consumption and have distorted beliefs about the likelihood of future income realisations, uncertainty about future states of the world has a direct effect on individual welfare. However, separating the effects of uncertainty from realised events and identifying the welfare effects of uncertainty both present a number of empirical challenges. Combining individual-level panel data from rural and urban Ethiopia with high-resolution meteorological data, we estimate the empirical relevance of uncertainty on objective consumption and subjective well-being. While negative income shocks affect both objective consumption measures and subjective well-being, greater income uncertainty only has an affect on subjective well-being. A one standard deviation change in income uncertainty is equivalent to a one standard deviation change in realised consumption. These results indicate that the welfare gains from further consumption smoothing are substantially greater than estimates based solely on consumption fluctuations.",2015.0,,LSE Research Online Documents on Economics,"Yonas Alem, J.

"Networks and Mis-allocation: Insurance, Migration, and the Rural-Urban Wage Gap","We provide an explanation for the large spatial wage disparities and low male migration in India based on the trade-off between consumption smoothing, provided by caste-based rural insurance networks, and the income gains from migration. Our theory generates two key empirically verified predictions: (i) males in relatively wealthy households within a caste who benefit less from the redistributive (surplus-maximizing) network will be more likely to migrate, and (ii) males in households facing greater rural income risk (who benefit more from the insurance network) migrate less. Structural estimates show that small improvements in formal insurance decrease the spatial misallocation of labor by substantially increasing migration.

Are traditional coping mechanisms effective in managing the risk against extreme events? Evidences from flood-prone region in rural India,"Livelihoods of rural poor in developing countries like India are exposed to risks due to natural disasters like floods. Although these risks are covariate, households are affected in varying degrees due to their location and their relative capacity to cope with them.

Household Financial Access and Risk Sharing in Nigeria,"We examine the role of household financial access in determining the extent of risk sharing in Nigeria using household-level panel data. We estimate changes in the response of consumption to shocks for households with formal and informal access to finance and those without, both for the country as a whole and for different regions. Our findings suggest that households with financial access who experience an unexpected negative income shock see consumption fall by 15 percentage points less than those without access. This result is mainly driven by households with informal financial access, and by household savings rather than borrowing. Regional variation in risk sharing tends to be significant, suggesting that financial inclusion efforts going forward should have a more regional focus.",2015.0,Social Science Research Network,International Monetary Fund (IMF) Research Paper Series,"S.

Insuring Against Health Shocks: Health Insurance and Household Choices,"This paper provides empirical evidence on the role of public health insurance in mitigating adverse outcomes associated with health shocks. Exploiting the rollout of a universal health insurance program in rural China, I find that total household income and consumption are fully insured against health shocks even without access to health insurance. Household labor supply is an important insurance mechanism against health shocks. Access to health insurance helps households to maintain investment in children's human capital during negative health shocks, which suggests that one benefit of health insurance could arise from reducing the use of costly smoothing mechanisms.",2015.0,Journal of Health Economics,Labor: Public Policy & Regulation eJournal,Kai Liu,10.2139/ssrn.2350710,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a462c57eedff66e8c8cb479a7ba63d7d6294b8fe,46.0,113.0,12.0,"['Medicine', 'Business']","[{'category': 'Medicine', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Business', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Medicine', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstreams/15c615ed-f7ad-4088-a968-91ed7df17eb7/download,['JournalArticle'],2015-05-01,True,True
Economic Impact of Illness With Health Insurance But Without Income Insurance,"We examine economic vulnerability to illness when, as for informal sector workers in Thailand, there is universal coverage for health care but earnings losses are uninsured. Even with comprehensive health care entitlement, severe illness that strikes an initially healthy worker is found to raise out-of-pocket medical expenses by around two thirds and increase the probability that medical spending absorbs more than a tenth of the household budget by nine percentage points. Moreover, severe illness reduces the probability of remaining in employment by 18 points and precipitates a reduction in household labor income of almost one third. Despite the rise in medical expenses and fall in earnings, households are able to maintain expenditure on goods and services other than medical care by drawing on remittances and informal transfers, cutting back on saving, and by borrowing. In the short term, informal insurance fills gaps left uncovered by formal insurance but there is likely to be subst antial exposure to economic risks associated with long-term illness.",2015.0,,Health Economics eJournal,"Sven Neelsen, C.

Domestic and Global Output Gaps as Inflation Drivers: What Does the Phillips Curve Tell?,"This paper provides new empirical insights on the joint distribution of consumption, income, and wealth in three of the poorest countries in the world — Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda — all located in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The first finding is that while income inequality is similar to that of the United States (US), wealth inequality is barely one-third that of the US. Similarly, while the top of the income distribution (1 and 10 percent) earns a similar share of total income in SSA as in the US, the share of total wealth accumulated by the income-rich in SSA is one-fifth of its US counterpart. The main contributions of the paper are to document: (i) this dwarfed transmission from income to wealth, which suggests that SSA households face a larger inability to save and accumulate wealth compared with US households; and (ii) a lower transmission from income to consumption inequality, which suggests the presence of powerful institutions that favor consumption insurance to the detriment of saving. These features are more relevant for rural areas, which represent roughly four-fifths of the total population.

RISK SHARING WITH LIMITED COMMITMENT AND PREFERENCE HETEROGENEITY: STRUCTURAL ESTIMATION AND TESTING,"In order to analyze the role of limited commitment and preference heterogeneity in explaining the consumption allocation, I propose a theoretical and empirical framework to estimate and evaluate a risk-sharing model where insurance transfers have to be self-enforcing and the coefficient of relative risk aversion may depend on observable household characteristics. I compare this model to benchmark models with full commitment and/or without preference heterogeneity using data from three Indian villages. I find that the limited commitment model with heterogeneous preferences outperforms the benchmark models in a statistical sense and in terms of (i) explaining the dynamic response of consumption to idiosyncratic income shocks, (ii) accounting for the variation of consumption unexplained by household and time effects, and (iii) capturing the variation of inequality across time and villages and predicting changes in inequality. I also use the estimated models to predict the effects of a counterfactual tax and transfer policy on the consumption allocation.

Informal Network Finance as a Risk Coping Device in Mountainous Laos,"Rural households in developing countries face difficulty in no small part in managing emergent expenditures on various events. It is commonly observed that rural households put up money for each other and swap small amounts of rice or other food stuffs with neighbors to cope with idiosyncratic shocks. This network finance plays an important role in supporting rural households facing an emergency with little or no administrative cost, especially in the society where formal safety-net mechanisms are de facto absent. As network finance is likely to function within a narrow range of blood and geographical proximity, the households tend to form a network in similar economic circumstances. Then, it can be assumed that the effectiveness of network finance will be vulnerable for the poor households whose network members belong to a similar stratum. This paper examines the accessibility of the poor to network finance, using household data collected in the hinterlands of Luang Prabang, Laos. We found that the poor can resort feebly to network finance. Therefore, the role of savings groups to mitigate shocks is more important for the poorer households.",2015.0,,Southeast Asian Studies,"Akihiko Ohno, Chaleunsinh Chansathith",10.20495/SEAS.3.SUPPLEMENTARYISSUE_73,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab7b09fa51bf813e8a823f01ca1176a19c878859,25.0,4.0,0.0,['Economics'],"[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Sociology', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",False,,,2015-03-31,True,True

"Handling the weather : insurance, savings, and credit in West Africa","Farmers in developing countries face a wide array of risks. Yet they often lack formal financial instruments to protect against risks. This paper examines the impact on consumption, investment, and welfare of the separate provision of three financial products: weather insurance, savings, and credit. The paper develops a dynamic stochastic mode to capture the essential features of the lives of West African rural households. The model is calibrated with data from farmers in Burkina Faso and Senegal, to assess quantitatively the effects of three policy interventions. For each intervention the analysis first considers a benchmark scenario that abstracts from the flaws that affect each instrument; later the assumptions are relaxed. Weather insurance offers the largest welfare gains at each level of wealth, although the gains are significantly reduced by introducing a multiple on the insurance premium. Over time, however, savings can lead to substantial gains, higher than those achievable by unsubsidized weather insurance.",2015.0,,,F.

Managing Risk with Insurance and Savings: Experimental Evidence for Male and Female Farm Managers in the Sahel,"Although there is fast-growing policy interest in offering financial products to help rural households manage risk, the literature is still scant as to which products are the most effective. This paper uses a randomized field experiment in Senegal and Burkina Faso to compare male and female farmers who are offered index-based agricultural insurance with those who are offered a variety of savings instruments. The paper finds that female farm managers were less likely to purchase agricultural insurance and more likely to invest in savings for emergencies, even controlling for access to informal insurance and differences in crop choice. It is hypothesized that this finding results from the fact that, although men and women are equally exposed to yield risk, women face additional sources of lifecycle risk -- particularly health risks associated with fertility and childcare -- that men do not. In essence, the basis risk associated with agricultural insurance products is higher for women. Purchasing insurance increased input spending and use more than savings. Those who purchased more insurance realized higher average yields and were better able to manage food insecurity and shocks. This finding suggests that gender differences in demand for financial products can have an impact on productivity, resilience, and welfare.",2015.0,,Risk Management eJournal,"Clara Delavallade, F.

The Impact of Index-Based Insurance on Informal Risk-Sharing Arrangement.,"Moral hazard and adverse selection impede the development of formal crop insurance markets in developing countries. Besides, the risk mitigation provided by informal risk-sharing arrangements is restricted by their inability to protect against covariate shocks. In this context, index-based insurance is seen as a promising scheme as it is immune to moral hazard and adverse selection and may offer effective protection against covariate shocks. It would thus seem that the two institutions are ideal complements. Unfortunately, this intuition ignores the potential effects on incentives and behavior generated by the interaction between both schemes. This paper explores this interaction in a model with moral hazard and shows that the formal contract may crowd out informal risk-sharing if it is offered to individuals. Second, we find that both risk-taking and welfare may be reduced by the introduction of index insurance if the premium is set too high. If the formal insurance is offered to the group instead of the individual, the impact on moral hazard is internalized and welfare increases.",2014.0,,Microeconomics: Decision-Making under Risk & Uncertainty eJournal,"S.

Our analysis was based on a unique data set with 10 years of recall data on school attendance and household shocks. We found that the probability of a child dropping out of school increased significantly when the household experienced an illness, death or asset shock. We proposed a test to distinguish whether the impact of shocks on school attendance could be attributed to credit constraints, labour market rigidities, or a combination of the two.

"Risk Sharing, Public Policy and the Contribution of Islamic Finance","A major reason for the recurrent episodes of financial instability is the predominance of interest-based debt and leveraging. Financial stability is achievable through risk sharing finance instead of risk shifting that characterizes contemporary finance. A risk sharing system serves the true function of finance as facilitator of real sector activities and avoids the emergence of a “paper economy” where there is gradual decoupling of finance from the real sector. Islamic finance was initially proposed as a profit-loss sharing system, but its core principle is risk sharing. In prohibiting interest-based debt instruments, Islam grounds finance on a strong risk sharing footing. Although still a young industry that has come a long way, it has not managed to develop truly risk-sharing instruments that would allow individuals, households, and firms as well as whole economies to mitigate systematic and un-systematic risks. It is suggested that governments should intervene and issue macro-market instruments to provide their treasuries with a significant source of non-interest rate based financing while promoting risk sharing. Moreover, given that evidence across the world suggests that monetary policy’s transmission mechanism may be impaired, it is suggested that these government issued securities could also impart added potency to monetary policy.

Saving for a (Not So) Rainy Day: A Randomized Evaluation of Savings Groups in Mali,"High transaction and contracting costs are often thought to create credit and savings market failures in developing countries. The microfinance movement grew largely out of business process innovations and subsidies that reduced these costs. We examine an alternative approach, one that infuses no external capital and introduces no change to formal contracts: an improved ""technology"" for managing informal, collaborative village-based savings groups. Such groups allow, in theory, for more efficient and lower- cost loans and informal savings, and in practice have been scaled up by international non-profit organizations to millions of members. Individuals save together and then lend the accumulated funds back out to themselves. In a randomized evaluation in Mali, we find improvements in food security, consumption smoothing, and buffer stock savings. Although we do find suggestive evidence of higher agricultural output, we do not find overall higher income or expenditure. We also do not find downstream impacts on health, education, social capital, and female decision-making power. Could this have happened before, without any external intervention? Yes.

Direct and Indirect Effects of Cash Transfers on Entrepreneurship,"This paper exploits a liquidity shock from a welfare program in Brazil to investigate the role of financial constraints, in opposition to general equilibrium mechanisms, in explaining entrepreneurship. Previous research focuses exclusively on how liquidity changes recipients’ behavior through direct effects on reducing constraints. However, liquidity shocks may also produce spillovers from recipients to others and thereby indirectly affect entrepreneurial decisions. This paper presents a method for decomposing the liquidity shock into direct effects associated with relieving individual constraints, and indirect effects associated with spillovers to other individuals. Results suggest that the program, which assists 20 percent of Brazilian households, increased the number of small entrepreneurs by 10 percent. However, this increase is entirely driven by the indirect effect. Further tests suggest that this effect is associated with an increase in private transfers between households. Thus, entrepreneurship tends to respond more to the interaction between households than to financial constraints.",2014.0,,,Rafael P.

This rejection, nevertheless, is supported by the existence of evidence of partial insurance for the whole country case.

Do the Poor Benefit Less from Informal Risk-Sharing? Risk Externalities and Moral Hazard in Decentralized Insurance Arrangements,"Empirical evidence on developing countries highlights that poor farm-households are less keen to adopt high risk / high return technologies than rich households. Yet, they tend to be more vulnerable to income shocks than the rich. This paper develops a model of informal risk-sharing with endogenous risk-taking which provides a rationale for these observations. In our framework, informal risk-sharing is incomplete due to risk externalities, which leads to moral hazard. We compare the .rst best and second best to a decentralized bargaining process, where the lack of coordination ampli.es moral hazard. The analysis of group composition yields counterintuitive results. First, if groups are homogeneous, poor groups share less risks than rich groups even though the rich take more risks. Second, the insurance level of rich households decreases in the presence of poor households, potentially making them reluctant to share risk with poorer households.",2014.0,,Emerging Markets: Finance eJournal,"Matthieu Delpierre, Bertrand Verheyden, S.

Do remittances help smooth consumption during health shocks?: Evidence from Jamaica,"Remittances represent about 15 percent of Jamaica’s GDP; being the 16th country worldwide in terms of economic significance of remittances. Therefore, assessing to what extent and through what mechanisms remittances are useful for development is highly relevant. Accordingly, we identify whether remittances facilitate consumption smoothing during health shocks in Jamaica. In addition, we investigate whether remittances are subject to moral hazard by receivers, how the informal insurance provided by remittances interacts with formal health insurance, and whether there are differential effects by gender of the household head. Disentangling causality between remittances and household income or consumption is problematic as a result of reverse causation. Therefore, identifying whether remittances serve as a social insurance mechanism toward consumption smoothing would require the existence of an exogenous and unexpected shock suffered by nonreceivers and receivers. In this article, we exploit health shocks (accidents and illnesses) suffered by household members to identify the relevance of remittances as social insurance toward consumption smoothing. After showing that these shocks are as good as randomly assigned, we assess the relevance and significance of remittances as a social insurance mechanism in Jamaica. Our main findings show that health shocks adversely affect total household expenditures by an average of 19 percent. However, remittances totally offset these adverse effects, indicating that in light of idiosyncratic shocks, remittances serve as a social insurance mechanism that offers full protection. We also find that moral hazard concerns are low given that remittances are not used to smooth consumption of presumably undesirable goods for senders such as alcohol. Furthermore, we find that remittances are not relevant as an insurance mechanism against health shocks when private health insurance is present. By contrast, remittances constitute a powerful form of insurance in the absence of private health insurance. In terms of policymaking, our findings identify a particularly vulnerable population: persons without private health insurance who do not receive remittances. Therefore, developing mechanisms to identify this population could serve for targeting complementary safety nets towards this particularly vulnerable group.",2014.0,,The Journal of Developing Areas,"Diether W.

We argue theoretically and empirically that experimental measures may not identify preference parameters, but are a useful tool for understanding financial shocks and constraints.

After the Drought: The Impact of Microinsurance on Consumption Smoothing and Asset Protection,"&NA; To cope with shocks, poor households with inadequate access to financial markets can sell assets to smooth consumption and, or reduce consumption to protect assets. Both coping strategies can be economically costly and contribute to the transmission of poverty, yet limited evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of insurance to mitigate these costs in risk‐prone developing economies. Utilizing data from an RCT in rural Kenya, this paper estimates that on average an innovative microinsurance scheme reduces both forms of costly coping. Threshold econometrics grounded in theory reveal a more complex pattern: (i) wealthier households primarily cope by selling assets, and insurance makes them 96 percentage points less likely to sell assets following a shock; (ii) poorer households cope primarily by cutting food consumption, and insurance reduces by 49 percentage points their reliance on this strategy.",2013.0,American Journal of Agricultural Economics,American Journal of Agricultural Economics,"S.

THE WELFARE GAINS OF FINANCIAL LIBERALIZATION: CAPITAL ACCUMULATION AND HETEROGENEITY,"Research has shown that, absent individual heterogeneity and under complete markets, the welfare impact of financial openness is quantitatively limited. Not only are inequalities in wealth and labor productivity a feature of most societies, but also financial markets suffer from many well-known frictions. This paper demonstrates that, when households face borrowing constraints and uninsurable idiosyncratic shocks to income, the welfare implications of financial liberalization are considerable. For instance, the average increase in welfare of a typical emerging market economy that switches from a closed capital market to perfect capital mobility is equivalent to a permanent increase in average consumption of roughly 5.4%. This is about 3.9 times more than the welfare gains of the same policy under a complete markets environment without any individual heterogeneity. We show that individual heterogeneity accounts for two thirds of this additional increase in the average welfare gain; market incompleteness accounts for the remaining third. In our calibration, the median household in capital-scarce countries is in favor of international financial integration. However, if the pivotal voter is wealthy enough then such reform might not be implemented, since richer households have a vested interest in capital market closedness.",2013.0,,Journal of the European Economic Association,"António R.

Health insurance coverage for low-income households : consumption smoothing and investment,"I estimate the effects of public health insurance on consumption smoothing and investigate the extent to which the public insurance interacts with private arrangements of self-insurance. Exploiting a dramatic expansion in health insurance coverage in rural China, I find that the introduction of public health insurance helps households completely insure against severe health shocks.

Vulnerability and Responses to Risks in Rural India,"Using Vulnerability as Expected Utility (VEU) analysis that permits the decomposition of household vulnerability into its components on a unique data set this paper demonstrates that in rural India household vulnerability is most explained by poverty and idiosyncratic components. So far as risk coping strategies go households rely heavily on informal instruments such as their own saving, transfers or capital depletion. However, they also try to cope with covariate risks by participating in government programmes. Further, household consumption is highly covariate with income. This implies that existing informal insurance instruments are not sufficient to protect household consumption against income shocks. Government sponsored coping strategies reduce the idiosyncratic and risk component of vulnerability. Hence, an important policy implication of our analysis is that the government should provide readily accessible and well targeted public safety nets. The existing informal strategy is not very effective as a consumption insurance mechanism. Although the government coping programme is found to reduce vulnerability access to such programmes is constrained. Expansion of government sponsored coping programmes is likely to protect households effectively from negative shocks.",2013.0,,Behavioral & Experimental Economics eJournal,"R. Jha, W. Kang, H.

"Microinsurance in Pakistan: Progress, Problems, and Prospects","Microinsurance in Pakistan is still in its nascent stages. More than half of the current microinsurance policies in effect in Pakistan are offered through the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP), with the remainder provided in conjunction with microcredit services offered by various microfinance institutions (MFIs), microfinance banks, nongovernment organizations, and rural support programs (RSPs). The policies offered by the microcredit sector are mainly credit-life policies, which cover loan balances inthe event of the borrower’s death. In addition, some lenders—principally the RSPs—offer small health insurance policies covering the hospitalization of the borrower and (sometimes) their spouse. As catastrophic health expenses and deaths in the family are among the most important economic stressors that households face, it makes sense that microinsurance should first make inroads in these areas. It is difficult to say what impact microinsurance has had in Pakistan, since few rigorous evaluations have been undertaken to date. What we do know is that utilization has been low, explained by providers as limited client awareness of the benefits and coverage. In the short to medium term, microinsurance outreach can be expanded by offering health microinsurance (HMI) coverage to microcredit borrowers’ entire households, and by offering HMI to all community members within an RSP, rather than only microloan borrowers and their spouses. Partnering with mobile phone operators for automated, digital payments can also significantly expand potential customer volume while reducing transaction costs. HMIs might also be combined with healthsavings accounts that households can use to pay for medications and outpatient services not covered by HMI plans. Provinces could also leverage the existing database of poverty scorecards implemented by BISP to channel partially government-subsidized microinsurance policies toward poor households just above the BISP threshold.",2013.0,,Population,"T.

"Productivity, credit, risk, and the demand for weather index insurance in smallholder agriculture in Ethiopia","The article explores the relationship between fertilizer use and the demand for weather index insurance (WII) among smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. We examine whether fertilizer use is profitable under current smallholder production conditions, whether risk-related factors affect fertilizer use, and we estimate the returns to inputs in the agricultural production function in the absence of insurance. We then study how these primitives of agricultural production functions relate to insurance demand. The study compares a survey-based estimate of willingness to pay with actual uptake for the weather insurance, finding the stated and actual demand to be almost completely uncorrelated. While those with high marginal returns to inputs say they would purchase insurance, only those with low marginal returns actually do, consistent with the stated purpose of the product as input insurance. Insurance demand proves to be highly responsive to the existence and amount of randomly allocated insurance vouchers.

Crowding Out of Solidarity? – Public Health Insurance versus Informal Transfer Networks in Ghana,"This paper delivers empirical evidence on how informal transfers are affected by a formal and country-wide health insurance scheme. Using the fifth wave of the Ghanaian Living Standard Household Survey, we investigate the extent to which the exogenous implementation of the National Health Insurance Scheme affects the probability of making or receiving informal transfers and their monetary equivalents. Our findings suggest that there is a significant crowding out of informal transfers. Members of weak transfer networks and individuals that run an enterprise are inclined to reduce their amount of remittances.

"Determinants of Enrolment in Voluntary Health Insurance: Evidences from a Mixed Method Study, Kerala, India","Background &Objectives: Financial burden on households due to healthcare is high in India but only small segments of the population are covered with health insurance. This study has two objectives: 1. to investigate the factors affecting enrolment in voluntary health insurance, and 2. to examine the characteristics of enrolment in terms of income-related inequality and adverse selection problem. Data and Methods: This is a cross sectional study. Mixed method approaches- qualitative and quantitative methodswere used. In-depth interviews were conducted among officials of insurance companies, insurance consultants (insurance agents), insured and uninsured people. Subsequently, household surveys among insured and uninsured were carried to examine the significance of the determinants on enrolment. Results: In addition to income, education and health risk, the level of awareness of people about insurance and the significant role of insurance consultants matter in the enrolment in voluntary health insurance. The enrolment in health insurance is characterised by income-related inequality in enrolment, and ii) no adverse selection. Conclusion: We identified several demand and supply side factors negatively and positively affecting the enrolment. This study suggest that, in addition to developing a competitive insurance market with the availability of attractive health insurance products and ensuring reimbursement about eligible claims, appropriate policy measures such as promoting people’s awareness on insurance and introducing better incentive structures for insurance consultants are needed to increase enrolment in health insurance.",2013.0,,Insurance & Financing in Health Economics eJournal,Sukumar Vellakkal,10.5430/IJFR.V4N2P99,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c95751951aa9b28f51fc8b06948b27001f427269,36.0,15.0,0.0,['Business'],"[{'category': 'Business', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Economics', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}, {'category': 'Medicine', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://www.sciedu.ca/journal/index.php/ijfr/article/download/2658/1513,['Review'],2013-04-08,True,True

Sharing as Risk Pooling in a Social Dilemma Experiment,"In rural economies with missing or incomplete markets, idiosyncratic risk is frequently pooled through informal networks. Idiosyncratic shocks, however, are not limited to private goods but can also restrict an individual from partaking in or benefitting from a collective activity. In these situations, a group must decide whether to provide insurance to the affected member. In this paper, we describe results of a laboratory experiment designed to test whether a simple sharing institution can sustain risk pooling in a social dilemma with idiosyncratic risk. We test whether risk can be pooled without a commitment device and, separately, whether effective risk pooling induces greater cooperation in the social dilemma. We find that even in the absence of a commitment device or reputational considerations, subjects voluntarily pool risk thereby reducing variance in individual earnings.

Cash Transfers in an Epidemic Context: The Interaction of Formal and Informal Support in Rural Malawi,"This paper investigates the short-run consumption expenditure dynamics and the interaction of public and private arrangements of ultra-poor and labor-constrained households in Malawi using an original dataset from the Mchinjii social cash transfer pilot project (one of the first experiments of social protection policies based on unconditional cash transfers in Sub-Saharan Africa). The authors exploit the unique source of exogenous variation provided by the randomized component of the program in order to isolate the effect of cash transfers on consumption expenditures as well as the net crowding out effect of cash transfers on private arrangements. They find a statistically significant reduction effect on the level of consumption expenditures for those households receiving cash transfers, thus leading to the rejection of the perfect risk sharing hypothesis. Moreover, by looking at the effects of cash transfers on private arrangements in a context characterized by imperfect enforceability of contracts and by a social fabric heavily compromised by high HIV/AIDS rates, the analysis confirms the presence of crowding out effects on private arrangements when looking at gifts and (to a lesser extent) remittances, while informal loans seem to be completely independent from the cash transfer's reception. From a policy perspective, the paper offers a contribution to the evaluation of the very recent wave of social protection policies based on (unconditional) cash transfers in Sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that there might be an important role for public interventions aimed at helping households to pool risk more effectively.",2011.0,,Labor: Public Policy & Regulation eJournal,"Francesco Strobbe, Candace M.

We incorporate spatial peer interaction, defined as a child’s nearest geographical neighbors, into a production function of child cognitive development in Andhra Pradesh, India. Our peer group construction takes the form of directed networks, whose structure allows us to identify peer effects and enables us to disentangle endogenous effects from contextual effects. We exploit variation over time to avoid confounding correlated with social effects. Our results suggest that spatial peer and neighborhood effects are strongly positively associated with a child’s cognitive skill formation. These peer effects hold even when we consider an alternative IV-based identification strategy and different variations to network size.

"Strategies for coping with the costs of inpatient care: a mixed methods study of urban and rural poor in Vadodara District, Gujarat, India","Background In India, coping mechanisms for inpatient care costs have been explored in rural areas, but seldom among urbanites. This study aims to explore and compare mechanisms employed by the urban and rural poor for coping with inpatient expenditures, in order to help identify formal mechanisms and policies to provide improved social protection for health care. Methods A three-step methodology was used: (1) six focus-group discussions; (2) 800 exit survey interviews with users of public and private facilities in both urban and rural areas; and (3) 18 in-depth interviews with poor (below 30th percentile of socio-economic status) hospital users, to explore coping mechanisms in greater depth. Results Users of public hospitals, in both urban and rural areas, were poor relative to users of private hospitals. Median expenditures per day were much higher at private than at public facilities. Most respondents using public facilities (in both urban and rural areas) were able to pay out of their savings or income; or by borrowing from friends, family or employer. Those using private facilities were more likely to report selling land or other assets as the primary source of coping (particularly in rural areas) and they were more likely to have to borrow money at interest (particularly in urban areas). Poor individuals who used private facilities cited as reasons their closer proximity and higher perceived quality of care. Conclusions In India, national and state governments should invest in improving the quality and access of public first-referral hospitals. This should be done selectively—with a focus, for example, on rural areas and urban slum areas—in order to promote a more equitable distribution of resources. Policy makers should continue to explore and support efforts to provide financial protection through insurance mechanisms.

"ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE ON FARMING SYSTEMS IN THE MIDDLE BELT, NIGERIA","Agriculture continues to dominate economic development policy in many developing countries. This is hardly surprising given the high proportion of the population of such countries that derive their livelihood from agriculture and related activities. What is surprising in many of the countries is the failure of the policy to deliver the sustained supplies of food and industrial raw materials as intended. In part this may have occurred because they failed to address the inability of the peasant farmers to withstand the increased risks associated with the adoption of commercial farming practices. Agricultural insurance is seen as one of the best strategies to address farm risks and encourage farmers to embrace modern production practices with greater potential for better and quality yields. In Nigeria, the Government introduced agricultural insurance programme with the tripartite aim of broadening farmers’ access to farm resources, positively changing farmers’ attitude to risk in their choice of resource use and to achieve increased food supplies in the market. Different factors can be identified that influence farmers’ behaviour especially making decisions that relate to farm production, vis-a-vis choice of enterprise, its combination, the type and level of resources used in a given farming season. This study was carried out to examine whether agricultural insurance exerted any significant influence on the farming practices in the country. This study tests the broad hypothesis that farmers who purchase insurance increase their exposure to risk by adopting modern farming practices and achieved increase in resource productivity. The study found that the sampled farmers differ in their use of farm resources and the level of output produced. A higher proportion of insured farmers applied improved farming practices and were more commercially oriented. The insured farmers ventured into more risky enterprises and released a greater proportion of their output to the market for sale. However, contrary to expectations, uninsured farmers were found to be more productive and efficient in their resource use than the insured farmers.",2009.0,,"African Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition and Development","S.

Transactional Sex as a Response to Risk in Western Kenya,"Formal and informal commercial sex work is a way of life for many poor women in developing countries. Though sex workers have long been identified as crucial in affecting the spread of HIV/AIDS, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, the nature of sex-for-money transactions remains poorly understood. Using a unique panel dataset constructed from 192 self-reported sex worker diaries which include detailed information on sexual behavior, labor supply, and health shocks, the authors find that sex workers adjust their supply of risky, better compensated sex to cope with unexpected health shocks, exposing themselves to increased risk of HIV infection. In particular, women are 3.1 percent more likely to see a client, 21.2 percent more likely to have anal sex, and 19.1 percent more likely to have unprotected sex on days in which a household member falls ill. Women also increase their supply of risky sex on days after missing work due to symptoms from a sexually transmitted infection. Given that HIV prevalence has been estimated at 9.8 percent in this part of Kenya, these behavioral responses entail significant health risks for sex workers and their partners, and suggest that sex workers are unable to cope with risk through other formal or informal consumption smoothing mechanisms.",2009.0,,Political Behavior: Race,"Jonathan Robinson, Ethan Yeh",10.2139/ssrn.1332563,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8c92d3d512a99c1700c9c1e98828bd226c8a2f6d,64.0,237.0,22.0,"['Economics', 'Medicine']","[{'category': 'Economics', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Medicine', 'source': 'external'}, {'category': 'Sociology', 'source': 's2-fos-model'}]",True,https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstreams/75e8d109-d3ff-52b2-956e-2cc16914da4b/download,,2009-01-24,True,True

Patterns of Rainfall Insurance Participation in Rural India,"Take-up of an innovative rainfall insurance policy offered to smallholder farmers in rural India decreases with basis risk between insurance payouts and income fluctuations, increases with household wealth, and decreases with binding credit constraints. These results are consistent with the predictions of a simple neoclassical model with borrowing constraints. Other patterns are less consistent with the benchmark model. For example, participation in village networks and measures of familiarity with the insurance vendor are strongly correlated with insurance take-up decisions, and risk-averse households are less, not more, likely to purchase insurance.

Poverty and Consumption Smoothing in Russia,"This paper investigates to what extent Russian households have been able to protect their consumption against income shocks during the transition and whether the ability to smooth consumption is related to poverty. We use the cross-section and panel dimensions of the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) from 1994 to 2004. Empirical analyses of such panels have often been based on differenced data in order to eliminate individual household effects. In this study household expenditures are modeled using an Error Correction Mechanism (ECM) which better exploits the information in the level data. The model makes an explicit distinction between short and long run dynamics of consumption. Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) estimates of the short run income elasticity are significantly positive and less than unity. In other words, we and that households can (only) partially protect themselves against income shocks. Furthermore, income shocks have smaller effects on food consumption than on non-food expenditures. We present some evidence that the population is not homogeneous in terms of consumption smoothing ability and that a low smoothing ability is not necessarily associated with a high poverty risk. For instance households with pensioners, who have a relatively low poverty risk, have a high smoothing ability; but rural households, who have a high poverty risk, also manage to smooth food expenditures quite well, most likely because of own food production opportunities. Nevertheless, the ability of households to smooth non-food expenditures tends to increase as their average expenditures rise above the poverty line. These exploratory results suggest that development and social protection policies not only play a role in terms of poverty reduction but also influence households' abilities to deal with income shocks.",2006.0,,Poverty,"Geranda Notten, D.

"Income Volatility, Risk-Coping Behavior and Consumption Smoothing Mechanisms in Developing Countries: A Survey","This paper provides a review of the general concepts and infl uential fi ndings of empirical research on risk-coping behavior and consumption smoothing arrangements in rural economies of developing countries. Low-income individuals live with high levels of risk and limited access to formal fi nancial systems for credit and insurance. In general, the evidence indicates that their informal mechanisms to mitigate risk play an important role in partially protecting their consumption. However, these alternatives do not allow rural households to achieve an optimal allocation of risk across time and income cycles and are costly on equity grounds. In addition, risks that remain uninsured seem to have adverse long term welfare consequences. Public interventions can play a signifi cant role in improving the income security of rural households. In doing so, it is crucial to have a good understanding of the causes and not simply the symptoms of informal risk-coping behavior and its social welfare implications.",2006.0,,Development Economics,J.

The Economic Consequences of Health Shocks,"While there is a great deal of anecdotal evidence on the economic effects of adverse health shocks, there is relatively little hard empirical evidence. The author builds on recent empirical work to explore in the context of postreform Vietnam two related issues: (1) how far household income and medical care spending responds to health shocks, and (2) how far household consumption is protected against health shocks. The results suggest that adverse health shocks - captured by negative changes in body mass index (BMI) - are associated with reductions in earned income. This appears to be only partly - if at all - due to a reverse feedback from income changes to BMI changes. By contrast, there is a hint - the relevant coefficient is not significant - that adverse BMI shocks may result in increases in unearned income. This may reflect additional gifts, remittances, and so on, from family and friends following the health shock. Medical spending is found to increase following an adverse health shock, but not among those with health insurance. The impact for the uninsured is large, equal in absolute size to the income loss associated with a BMI shock. The lack of impact for the insured points to complete insurance against the medical care costs associated with health shocks, and is consistent with the very generous coverage of Vietnam's health insurance program in this period. The question arises: have Vietnamese households been able to hold their food and nonfood consumption constant in the face of these income reductions and extra medical care outlays? The results suggest not. For the sample as a whole, both food and nonfood consumption are found to be responsive to health shocks, indicating an inability to smooth nonmedical consumption in the face of health shocks. Further analysis reveals some interesting differences across different groups within the sample. Households with insurance come no closer to smoothing nonmedical consumption than uninsured households. Furthermore, and somewhat counterintuitively, better-off households - including insured households - fare worse than poorer households in smoothing their nonmedical consumption in the face of health shocks, despite the fact that in the case of insured households there are no medical bills associated with an adverse health event. Why the poor rely on dissaving and borrowing to such an extent, and do not apparently reduce their food and nonfood consumption following an adverse health shock while the better-off do, may be because the levels of food and nonfood consumption of the poor are simply too low relative to basic needs to enable them to cut back in the face of an adverse BMI shock.",2005.0,,,A.

Use of the Formal and Informal Financial Sectors: Does Gender Matter? Empirical Evidence from Rural Bangladesh,"Access to transfers and credit, whether cash or in-kind, is a major source of poverty alleviation and income generation in many developing countries around the world. Women may especially benefit from transfers and credit in countries such as Bangladesh, where they often have few work alternatives. In this paper, the authors descriptively examine the formal and informal financial sectors of rural Bangladesh, placing special emphasis on differences between men and women. Their analysis uses unique data on the credit and transfer behaviors of 1,800 households in rural Bangladesh. The authors focus on five important questions: a) How important are the formal and informal financial sectors? b) What are the primary sources of gifts and loans within those sectors? c) Do men and women rely on different sources for finances (for example, formal versus informal) or different types of finances (for example, transfers versus loans)? d) How have the financial sectors evolved during the 1990s? e) What is the relationship between the formal and informal sectors?",2004.0,,World Bank Policy Research Working Paper Series,"Signe-Mary McKernan, M.

It has long been hypothesized that these households keep livestock as a buffer stock to insulate their consumption from income fluctuations income. This paper tests this hypothesis. Results indicate that livestock transactions play less of a consumption smoothing role than often assumed.

Health Shocks and Overindebtedness: A Panel Data Analysis from Rural Viet Nam,"Rural households in developing countries have limited capacity to cope with and manage shocks, thereby resulting in chronic poverty, indebtedness, and a decline in overall well-being. Therefore, this study analyzes the effects of health shocks on overindebtedness in rural Viet Nam using four rounds of a balanced panel data set of about 1,750 households observed over a decade (2007, 2010, 2013, 2016). Employing the household-level fixed-effect model, this study finds that health shocks reduce household income and increase health expenditure among rural Vietnamese households. It also finds that households cope with health shocks mainly by borrowing from more sources. Households experiencing health shocks are 2.2 to 3.1 percentage points more likely to be overindebted, which occurs primarily among households without health insurance, suggesting that social health insurance can reduce households’ vulnerability to the consequences of health shocks. These findings strongly support efforts to expand access to social health insurance in rural Viet Nam.",2022.0,Social Science Research Network,SSRN Electronic Journal,"Panharoth Chhay, D.

To see the evolution of change in income and consumption we measured growth by taking 6, 8and 10-years’ difference respectively. The findings ascertained there is limited risk-sharing across cohorteducation groups in Pakistan, but the measured extent of risk-sharing increases over longer horizons. Furthermore, we observe relatively higher consumption smoothing among the less educated people over the period of ten years. In the university education group, results reveal less consumption smoothing in the shorter, sixand eight-year time periods.
